SUMMARY
Objectives: Secondary generalized tonic–clonic seizures (SGTCS) are among the
most severe forms of seizures, and the main risk factor for sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy (SUDEP). Whether some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) might be more efﬁca-
cious than others on SGTCS in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy thus repre-
sents an important clinical issue for which no data are currently available.
Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of adjunctive
AED in which information on efﬁcacy outcomes (i.e., responder rate and/or frequency
per 28 days relative to baseline) were available both for all seizure types and for
SGTCS. The primary analysis evaluated the efﬁcacy of AEDs on all types of seizure and
on SGTCS by comparing the responder rates for AED and for placebo.
Results: Responder rate was available both for all seizure types and for SGTCS in 13 of
the 72 eligible trials, evaluating 7 AEDs. Only three AEDs—lacosamide, perampanel
and topiramate—showed greater efﬁcacy than placebo. However, conﬁdence intervals
of relative risks overlapped for all AEDs but pregabalin, which demonstrated signiﬁ-
cantly lower efﬁcacy than lacosamide, perampanel, and topiramate. Moreover, there
was a nonsigniﬁcant trend toward a lower relative risk of responder rate for SGTCS
than for all seizure types, which appeared related to a greater response to placebo for
this outcome.
Signiﬁcance: Indirect comparison of AEDs using randomized placebo-controlled
add-on trials does not support robust differences between AEDs to prevent SGTCS.
Alternative designs for evaluation of therapeutic interventions in patients at risk for
SGTCS-related complications are required.

The presence and frequency of generalized tonic–clo-
nic seizures (GTCS; either primary or secondary gener-
alized [SGTCS]) were found to represent the strongest
risk factors for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
(SUDEP),1 with an odds ratio (OR) of >15 for patients
with three or more GTCS per month.2 SUDEP primar-
ily affects young adults with uncontrolled seizures, with

Over the last 20 years, the number of licensed AEDs
has increased exponentially, making the process of drug
selection difficult.5 Furthermore, randomized head-to-head
comparisons of available AEDs are lacking,6 while system-
atic reviews and meta-analyses of placebo-controlled
randomized trials have failed to demonstrate consistent
differences.7–11 However, these meta-analyses have assessed

the impact of treatment on focal seizures with or without
SGCTS, without specifically investigating SGTCS.

Why some focal seizures evolve to secondary generaliza-
tion while others do not in the same individual remains
poorly understood. Although the mechanisms underlying
these two seizure types might not differ at their initiation
phase, secondary generalization might reflect involvement
of specific mechanisms, both at the cellular and network
levels.12–15 In vitro studies suggest that seizure initiation
and propagation might be triggered by different alterations
of synaptic transmission.13,14 In patients, specific cortical
and subcortical networks are thought to be involved during
secondary generalization.12,15,16 Based on these observa-
tions, one can speculate that some AEDs might be more effi-
cacious than others to prevent secondary generalization,
while they would not necessarily differ in their efficacy to
prevent initiation of focal seizures. To address this issue, we
undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of adjunctive AED for which SGTCS outcome was
available.

Materials and Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of
placebo-controlled double-blind adjunctive-therapy RCTs
of licensed and investigational AEDs in adults with refrac-
tory focal epilepsy using methods similar to those we previ-
ously reported.11 Our study met the preferred reporting
items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines.

Two electronic databases (MEDLINE and Web of Sci-
ence) were searched from 1960 to August 31, 2013 (Data
S1). Additional RCTs were searched on the following: (1)
registry websites; (2) the abstracts of the International and
the European Congresses of
the International League
Against Epilepsy (ILAE), and the abstracts of the Annual
Meetings of the American Epilepsy Society and the Ameri-
can Academy of Neurology; and (3) the references of all
identified publications.

To qualify for inclusion, an RCT had to meet the follow-
ing criteria: (1) efficacy as a primary endpoint; (2) informa-
tion on number of arms and corresponding dosages; (3)
a minimum baseline period of 4 weeks and a minimum
treatment period of 6 weeks; (4) information on efficacy
outcomes (i.e., responder rate and/or frequency per 28 days
relative to baseline) available both for all seizure types (sim-
ple or complex focal seizures, with or without secondary
generalizations) and for secondary generalized tonic–clonic
seizures (SGTCS); and (5) results reported according to
intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.

Some AEDs have been evaluated as add-on therapy in
patients with refractory primary GTCS.17 Considering the
variability of efficacy profile of AEDs across epilepsy syn-
dromes,5 pooling data obtained in focal epilepsies with
those obtained in primary generalized epilepsies might be

misleading. In this context, RCTs evaluating AEDs in
patients with refractory primary GTCS were not included in
the current study.

Data were independently extracted by two authors (CH
and SR) using predefined data fields, including trials and
patients’ characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. The
Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias18
was used to ascertain the validity of eligible RCTs.

The primary end point was the responder rate (proportion
of patients with ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency during
the treatment period as compared to baseline). The respon-
der rate for all types of seizure was calculated using the ITT
population (defined as all randomized patients) as denomi-
nator and the number of responders as numerator, as defined
by the standard last observation carried forward (LOCF)
method.11 The SGTCS responder rate was calculated using
the number of randomized patients who demonstrated
SGTCS during the baseline period as denominator and the
number of patients with ≥50% reduction in SGTCS fre-
quency during the treatment period as numerator, as defined
by the LOCF method. Because a large majority of trials
lacked information regarding the number of patients without
SGTCS during baseline but who had a SGCTS during dou-
ble-blind phase (see Table 1), such patients could not be
included in the primary analyses. To evaluate the potential
bias resulting from this approach, a sensitivity analysis was
performed using the few trials providing data on patients
with SGTCS during double-blind phase but not during
baseline, who were counted as nonresponders. Another sen-
sitivity analysis was performed by restricting data analysis
to approved doses (defined as the doses recommended in the
product
information approved by the Food and Drug
Administration [FDA] in the United States and/or European
Medicines Agency [EMA] in Europe).

We evaluated the efficacy of AEDs on all types of seizure
and on SGTCS by comparing the responder rate in the AED
treatment group with that observed in the placebo group,
using the logarithm of relative risk (RR) method. Treatment
effect and heterogeneity tests were performed by setting a
statistical significance level at <0.05 for treatment effect
and a threshold of <0.10 for heterogeneity (Cochrane’s
Q-test). Heterogeneity was also assessed by the I2 statistic,
which is independent of the number of studies and quanti-
fies heterogeneity on a scale of 0–100%. Very large hetero-
geneity between studies is denoted by I2 values of ≥75%. In
the absence of a clear explanation for heterogeneity, fixed-
effect models for RR were planned. Funnel plots were used
to investigate small study bias (e.g., publication bias).

An exploratory analysis was performed using the change
in SGTCS frequency per 28 days relative to baseline rather
than responder rate as efficacy end point. This endpoint was
analyzed using effect size, consisting of a difference
between each treated group and control arms in the change
between treatment period and baseline, using the LOCF
method. Data were then pooled by tested doses for each

Prevention of SGTCS in Focal Epilepsy

AED. This analysis required use of mean value and standard
deviation of the outcome in each intervention group.18
However, reports from RCTs preferentially provide median
value for each study arm rather than mean value, and vari-
ability is usually not detailed. Although we could not assess
whether the distribution of data was symmetrical, we con-
sidered median values as mean values. In addition, standard
deviations were extrapolated from p-values for differences
in means/medians between treatment arms and placebo
using the approach proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration
Group.18 Meta-analyses were performed using the software
EasyMA (M. Cucherat, Lyon, France).

Results

The search for RCTs of any AED in the adjunctive-
therapy treatment of refractory focal epilepsy identified
6,078 publications. Exclusion of irrelevant and duplicate
publications after review of the abstracts reduced the
number of trials to 278. Of these, 206 were excluded
for the reasons listed in Figure 1, leaving a total of 72
eligible trials.

Only 24 (33%) of these 72 eligible trials provided effi-
cacy data for SGTCS and were included in further analyses.
Fifty percent responder rates for SGTS were available in the
original publication for 10 studies (14%) and could be
retrieved from a post hoc study19 for three additional trials
evaluating perampanel.20–22 Change in SGTCS frequency
per 28 days relative to baseline was available in 22 studies
(38.7%). However, variability of the SGTCS frequency
change could not be extrapolated in 7 of them and, there-
fore, only 15 studies (21%) contributed to this outcome in
the meta-analysis. Seven studies contributed to both out-
comes (see Table 1). In contrast, three studies that provided
median reduction from baseline in 28-day SGTCS fre-
quency without
information allowing extrapolation of
variability and without SGTCS 50% responder rates, did not
contribute to any outcome.23–25

Overall, the 24 included RCTs evaluated 12 AEDs, all
but one (carisbamate) being currently licensed as adjunc-
tive-therapy treatment for refractory focal epilepsy. All of
them were second-generation AEDs, with no RCT having
evaluated older generation AED meeting the eligibility cri-
teria. The 13 RCTs providing the SGTCS responder rate
evaluated 7 AEDs (lacosamide, perampanel, pregabalin,
tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin, and zonisamide). The 15
studies that contributed to the exploratory analysis of
median reduction from baseline in 28-day SGTCS fre-
quency also evaluated 7 AEDs (carisbamate, levetiracetam,
oxcarbazepine, perampanel, pregabalin, rufinamide, and
topiramate).

Validity of eligible RCTs was ascertained with the Coch-
rane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias.18 Study
design was adequate in all but two RCTs, which did not
provide complete information about sequence generation,

allocation concealment, and blinding. Because efficacy data

eligible RCTs, the possibility of reporting bias should be
considered when interpreting the results.

The main characteristics and results of the 24 included
studies are summarized in Table 1. A total of 7,823 patients
were enrolled, one third of whom were allocated to placebo.
Among included patients, 37.4 (cid:3) 10.4% demonstrated

SGTCS during baseline period (range 10.4–50.3%). Base-
line SGTCS frequency was provided in only 10 studies. In
the latter, the median baseline SGTCS frequency was typi-
cally ranging from 2 to 3.5 per month (see Table 1). Only 6
of the 24 trials provided the number of patients who did not
have SGTCS during baseline, but had one during double-
blind phase, including two that could contribute to our
primary outcome (i.e., 50% responder rate) (Table 1). How-
ever, SGTCS frequency during the treatment period was not
provided for these patients.

Meta-analysis and indirect comparisons of responder
rates are presented in Figure 2. Only three of the seven
AEDs included in the analysis (lacosamide, perampanel,
and topiramate) showed significantly greater reduction of
SGTC frequency than placebo. AEDs that failed to prove
more efficacious than placebo were those tested with the
smallest sample size, possibly accounting for the lack of sig-
nificant difference as compared to placebo. With the excep-
tion of pregabalin, which demonstrated significantly lower
efficacy than lacosamide, perampanel, and topiramate, con-
fidence interval (CIs)s overlapped for all other AEDs, indi-
cating that differences
in point estimates were not
statistically significant. Results remained similar when
analyses were reprocessed using approved doses only
(Fig. S1).

A nonsignificant trend toward a lower efficacy over
SGTCS than over all seizure types was observed for all
AEDs (Fig. 2). This lower effect size was related to greater
response to placebo for SGTCS. Although responder rates
were significantly greater for SGTCS than for all seizure
types both in active treatment arms and in placebo groups,
this variation was indeed greater with placebo than with
AED. The mean (cid:3) standard deviation (SD) 50% responder
rate with AEDs was 36.3 (cid:3) 9.0% for all seizure types and

56.7 (cid:3) 15.8% for SGTCS (p < 0.001 by Mann-Whitney
U-test). In placebo groups, the mean (cid:3) SD 50% responder
rate was 16.1 (cid:3) 8.3% for all seizure types and 39.3 (cid:3)
16.1% for SGTCS (p < 0.001 by Mann-Whitney U-test).
Accordingly, 50% responder
for SGTCS was
303 (cid:3) 164% higher than that for all seizure types in pla-
cebo arms, and 162 (cid:3) 45% higher
in AEDs groups
(p = 0.016 by Mann-Whitney U-test).

rates

The impact of excluding patients who had SGTCS during
double-blind phase but not during baseline on the RRs of
the 50% responder rate was evaluated in two trials.26,27 In
one study,26 whether such patients were excluded or not
from the analysis resulted in similar RRs (1.25, 95% CI
0.62–2.53 vs. 1.23 95% CI 0.59–2.55, respectively). In the
other study,27 the RR was significantly greater when count-
ing these patients as nonresponders than when excluding
them from the analysis (3.09 95% CI 1.09–8.0 vs. 1.90 95%
CI 0.73–4.94, respectively). Another four studies provided
the number of patients who had SGTCS during the double-
blind phase but not during baseline, but without providing
the 50% responder rate23,25,28,29 (Table 1). However, we
could compare the proportion of such patients between the
active treatment and placebo groups. This proportion was
greater in the placebo group in two studies (i.e., 7.1% vs.
1.9%,29 and 12.7% vs. 11.5%23), whereas the opposite was
observed in the two other studies (4.3% vs. 5% and 9.3% in
the two active treatment arms,28 and 3.3% vs. 6.6%, 5.7%
and 5.3% in the three active treatment arms25).

Exploratory analysis of median reduction from base-
line in 28-day SGTCS frequency showed similar results
(Fig. 3). All evaluated AEDs but perampanel 2 mg/day
and 4 mg/day pregabalin,
rufinamide and topiramate
600 mg/day demonstrated significantly greater efficacy
than placebo. However, CIs overlapped for all AEDs and

Discussion

About a third of patients with drug-resistant focal epi-
lepsy have SGTCS.30 In these patients, occurrence of
SGTCS represents the main risk factor for SUDEP,2 which
these seizures appear to trigger in most instances.31 There is
currently no effective treatment to prevent SUDEP,32 apart
from reinforcing the AED regimen.4 In this context, preven-
tion of SGCTS might be an important parameter for treat-
ment choice in patients with refractory epilepsy. All AEDs
licensed for add-on therapy in drug-resistant focal epilepsy
are considered to prevent both focal seizures and SGTCS.

However, whether some AEDs might be more efficacious
than others on SGCTS remains unknown. The present work,
which aimed at addressing this issue, demonstrated the fol-
lowing: (1) although efficacy data on SGTCS are collected
during phase III RCTs, this specific outcome is rarely pro-
vided in trial’s reports; (2) one third of patients included in
regulatory trials have SGTCS during the baseline period,
with low baseline SGTCS frequency, further complicating
interpretation of data; (3) there is a nonsignificant trend
toward a lower relative risk of 50% responder rate for
SGTCS than for all seizure types, which appears related to a
greater response to placebo for this outcome; and (4)
although the available data do not support robust differences
between AEDs to prevent SGTCS in adult patients with
drug-resistant focal epilepsy, preferential use of the AEDs

outcome might be proposed.

These results primarily highlight the limitations of the
current RCT design for evaluating AEDs efficacy on
SGTCS. The main objectives of phase III add-on RCTs are
to evaluate efficacy and safety of new AEDs within a repre-
sentative sample of patients with drug-resistant
focal
epilepsy, taking into account the recommendations of regu-
latory authorities in terms of trial design and outcomes.6
Accordingly, no specific emphasis has been put on SGTCS
in add-on RCTs inclusion criteria. In this context, the pro-
portion of patients with focal seizures and SGTCS included
in these studies remains limited to about one third. More-
over, the monthly SGTCS rate is highly variable and often
low in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are
eligible for inclusion in phase III trials. The infrequent and
irregular occurrence of SGTCS raises important statistical
issues. Specifically, these characteristics result in higher
variance for this outcome than for all seizure types. Thus
study power, which depends on the variance of the outcome
and the sample size, is inappropriate for testing the efficacy
of AEDs on SGTCS only in classic phase III RCTs, result-
ing in increased risk of type II error. As shown in Table S1,
all RCTs but one demonstrated study power <50% to detect
a treatment difference of 25% for SGTCS, the effect size
usually assumed in phase III RCTs. In contrast, 20 of 24
studies had ≥80% power and 23 of 24 had ≥50% power to
detect the same effect size for all seizure types. As shown in
Table S2, a sample of 161 patients with SGTCS in each
treatment arm would have been required for 80% power to
detect a treatment difference of 25% in percentage change
in SGTCS frequency between placebo and active treatment
arm. In this context, we cannot exclude that treatment effi-
cacy on SGTCS was falsely undetected in negative trials.
Although the meta-analysis process might partly compen-
sate low power of individual studies, the precision of the
effect size evaluation remains impacted by the number of
underpowered studies included in the meta-analysis.33,34

The recommended primary efficacy outcome differs
across regulatory authorities, with the FDA recommending
the use of median reduction from baseline in 28-day seizure
frequency and the EMA recommending the use of the 50%
responder rate.35 For methodologic reasons, previous meta-
analyses of phase III RCTs focused on only 50% responder
rate.7–11 The primary objective of our study was to evaluate
the level of information for SGTCS in add-on RCTs; we
analyzed both 50% responder rate and median reduction
from baseline in 28-day SGTCS frequency. This approach
allowed us to provide a more accurate picture of the quality
of reporting of SGTCS-related outcomes in publications.
However, data variability being available in a minority of
studies, analyses of median reduction from baseline in
28-day SGTCS frequency should be interpreted with
caution. Specifically, extrapolation of means values from
median values in the absence of formal evaluation of data

distribution might have introduced significant bias. On the
other hand, the similarity of the qualitative results between
the two outcomes (i.e., 50% responder rates and median
reduction from baseline in 28-day SGTCS frequency) sug-
gests that this methodologic bias was limited.

It has been shown that the 50% responder rate in regula-
tory trials is also significantly impacted by methodologic
issues, including the method used to define responders (i.e.,
LOCF vs. completer methods) or the evaluation period (i.e.,
whole treatment vs. maintenance periods).11 For SGTCS,
only data obtained using the LOCF method were available,
which could lead to an overestimation of the 50% responder
rates,11 and did not allow comparison of the seizure-free rate
across AEDs.36 In addition, studies evaluating lacosamide
and perampanel20–22,37 provided data for SGTCS on the
maintenance period, whereas the other studies used the
whole treatment period as the evaluation period. This might
have negatively impacted the comparability of the studies.
Because relative risk of 50% responder rate appears signifi-
cantly lower when response is assessed over the mainte-
nance period compared with the entire treatment period,11
this bias might have lowered the SGTCS responder rate of
lacosamide and perampanel rather than increasing differ-
ences with the other AEDs.

Another potential bias in the interpretation of the SGTCS
50% responder rate is the lack of information in reports of
most RCTs regarding the number of patients with SGTCS
during the treatment period but not during baseline (see
Table 1), hampering the inclusion of these patients in our
primary analyses. These patients being by definition nonre-
sponders, their noninclusion might have resulted in overes-
timating the 50% responder rate. However, the magnitude
of this potential bias remains unclear. In the six studies
where we could assess this outcome, the proportion of ran-
domized patients without SGTCS during baseline who had
a SGTCS during the double-blind phase was greater,
similar, or lower in the placebo group than in the active
treatment groups.

It has been shown that interpretation and comparison of
add-on RCTs results is affected by a progressive increase of
the response to placebo.11,38 Although the exact mecha-
nisms underlying this evolution remain to be determined, it
has been suggested that nonpharmacologic phenomena
might be predominant, including the Hawthorne effect and
regression to the mean.11 Similar hypotheses might be pro-
posed to explain the unusually high response to placebo for
SGCTS observed in the current study. Specifically, it might
be speculated that regression to the mean might be greater
for SGTCS than for complex focal seizures, inasmuch as
patients with SGCTS during the treatment period but not
during baseline could not be included in our analyses.
According to the impact of SGTCS on quality of life,
patients might thus be more prone to be included in phase
III RCTs when they experience aggravation of SGTCS
frequency. In addition, tapering of an ongoing AED might

sometimes be required before inclusion within the trial, a
modification that might result in transient occurrence and/or
increased rate of SGTCS.

With the exception of pregabalin, which demonstrated
significantly lower efficacy than lacosamide, perampanel,
and topiramate, we did not observe significant difference
across AEDs for the prevention of SGTCS. However, all
previous factors drastically limited the representativeness of
the dataset and the interpretability of our results. Our results
must therefore be interpreted with caution. Whether they
reflect true equivalent efficacy of new AEDs on SGTCS or
just the paucity of available informative data remains an
open question. Similarly, whether the observation that only
three (i.e., perampanel, lacosamide, or topiramate) of the
seven AEDs for which SGTCS responder rates were avail-
able demonstrated significant superiority over placebo
might support their preferential use in patients with SGTCS
is questionable. Overall, phase III RCTs are not designed
and powered to appropriately evaluate SGTCS. Rather than
reflecting lack of interest into this seizure type, this situation
likely derives from the difficulty to enroll patients with fre-
quent SGTCS in placebo-controlled trials. Appropriate
evaluation of SGTCS in RCTs using the current design
would require the inclusion of patients with 3–4 SGTCS per
month, or running the trial for a very long time, raising
feasibility issues. This reinforces the need to develop alter-
native designs for the evaluation of new therapeutic inter-
ventions in epilepsy,39 especially in at-risk patients with
seizure-related complications and/or comorbidities.40
