Purpose: We investigated the prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) 

in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and the risk factors associated 

with them. We also studied the seizure outcome in patients with IGEs.

Methods:  In  this  retrospective  study,  all  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  IGE  were  re-

cruited  at  the  epilepsy  clinic  at  Shiraz  University  of  Medical  Sciences,  from  2008 

through 2019. Age, gender, age at seizure onset, seizure type(s), EEG findings, and 

seizure outcome of all patients were registered.

Results: A total of 601 patients with IGE were studied; 516 patients (86%) had GTCSs. 

The ROC curve showed that reporting GTCSs was significantly associated with the 

time since the start of the disease (P = .0001; area under the curve = 0.71 [95% CI: 

0.66-0.76]; a cutoff point of 4 years [sensitivity = 61% and specificity = 76%]). Age 

at onset was 3.3 years later in patients with GTCSs compared with that in patients 

without GTCSs. Generalized spike-wave complexes during interictal EEG recording 

were more frequently observed among patients without GTCSs. Generalized tonic-

clonic seizures were significantly associated with experiencing seizure-related inju-

ries. Valproate reduced the risk of experiencing GTCSs significantly (OR: 0.58; 95% 

CI: 0.34-0.99; P = .04).

Conclusion: Generalized tonic-clonic seizures do not affect the seizure outcome in 

patients with IGEs per se, but how we manage them significantly affects the seizure 

outcome in these patients. Failure to prescribe valproate for women with IGE, par-

ticularly when another first-line treatment has failed, may not be in a patient's best 

interests.

Idiopathic  (genetic)  generalized  epilepsies  (IGEs)  are  common  ep-

ilepsy  syndromes  with  generalized  seizures  (ie,  generalized  ton-

ic-clonic,  absence,  and/or  myoclonic  seizures),  that  are  diagnosed 
by  strict  clinical  and  electroencephalographic  (EEG)  criteria.1-3 

Idiopathic generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) is the most com-
mon seizure type among patients with IGE syndromes.1 Generalized

tonic-clonic seizures are also the most important of all seizure types 

in patients with epilepsy; GTCSs are associated with the highest risk 
of seizure-related injuries4 and also with a significant risk for prema-
ture deaths in patients with epilepsy.5,6

In the current study of GTCSs in patients with IGEs, we aimed 

to investigate the prevalence of GTCS in various syndromes of IGE. 

In addition, we investigated the risk factors associated with having 

GTCSs in patients with IGE. Finally, we studied their outcome and

In this retrospective study, all patients with a clinical diagnosis of IGE 

were recruited at the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Shiraz University 

of  Medical  Sciences,  from  2008  until  2019.  The  diagnosis  of  vari-

ous  IGE  syndromes  was  made  by  the  epileptologist  and  based  on 

the clinical grounds (including a detailed clinical history of all seizure 
types)  and  EEG  findings  (Ref.2,3).  There  were  no  exclusion  criteria 

and no age limits. All patients had to be under the care of the epilep-

tologist at our institution.

young  women  with  IGE  wisely  advise  against  the  use  of  valproate 
as the first-line AED.15 However, we should bear in mind that these 

guidelines  only  recommend  caution  regarding  teratogenic  risks  of 

valproate in women of child-bearing potential, but do not advocate 

absolute avoidance. Failure to prescribe valproate for patients with 

IGE, particularly when another first-line AED treatment (eg, lamotrig-

ine or levetiracetam) has failed, may not be in a young woman's best 

interests. Indiscriminate avoidance of valproate in women needs to 

be recognized as a misinterpretation of the current epilepsy guide-
lines, as it may harm young patients.16 Although the use of valproate 

demands careful consideration, there remains a strong case to always 

discuss this medication with the patients and their families. Patients 

must  be  allowed  to  make  their  own  informed  decisions  about  the 
most effective and safest epilepsy treatments.16 We strongly believe 

that the position taken by some drug companies and regulatory agen-

cies  on  valproate  use  in  women  (ie,  “Valproate  is  forbidden  during 

pregnancy and should no longer be prescribed to girls, teenagers and

very irrational and may cause harm to the patients.

Our  study  has  some  limitations.  This  was  a  clinic-based  series 

and may not represent the full spectrum of patients with IGE as the 

mildest  disease  varieties  may  not  be  referred  to  a  busy  university 

clinic (selection bias). In addition, data were collected retrospectively 

and  recall  bias  is  also  a  consideration.  However,  we  can  conclude 

that  GTCS  is  the  most  common  seizure  type  among  patients  with 

IGE  syndromes  and  the  chance  of  experiencing  GTCSs  is  a  func-

tion of the duration of the disease in these patients. Therefore, it is 

necessary to obtain a detailed clinical history on all possible seizure 

types during every follow-up visit of patients with IGE. In addition, 

GTCSs have a striking association with seizure-related injuries in pa-

tients  with  IGE,  and  in  order  to  reduce  the  risk  of  seizure-related 

harms,  it  is  important  to  bring  GTCSs  under  control.  Interestingly, 

GTCSs do not affect the seizure outcome in patients with IGEs per 

se,  but  how  we  manage  them  significantly  affects  the  seizure  out-

come in patients with IGE. Failure to prescribe valproate for women 

with  IGE,  particularly  when  another  first-line  AED  treatment  has 

failed, may not be in a patient's best interests.
