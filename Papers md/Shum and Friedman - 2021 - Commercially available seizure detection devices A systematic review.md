Seizure detection device 

Importance: Epilepsy can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection devices could 
be invaluable tools for both people with epilepsy, their caregivers, and clinicians as they could alert caretakers 
about seizures, reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, and provide objective and more reliable 
seizure tracking to guide treatment decisions or monitor outcomes in clinical trials. 
Objective: To synthesize the characteristics of commercial seizure detection tools/devices currently available. 
Methods: We performed a systematic search utilizing a diverse set of resources to identify commercially available 
seizure detection  products for consumer use. Performance data was obtained through a systematic review on 
commercially available products. 
Observations:  We  identified  23  products  marketed  for  seizure  detection/alerting.  Devices  utilize  a  variety  of 
mechanisms to detect seizures, including movement detectors, autonomic change detectors, electroencephalo-
gram (EEG) based detectors, and other mechanisms (audio). The optimal device for a person with epilepsy de-
pends  on  a  variety  of  factors  including  the  main  purpose  of  the  device,  their  age,  seizure  type  and  personal 
preferences. Only 8 devices have published peer-reviewed performance data and the majority for tonic-clonic 
seizures. An informed conversation between the clinician and the patient can help guide if a seizure detection 
device is appropriate. 
Conclusions  and  relevance:  Seizure  detection  devices  have  a  potential  to  reduce  morbidity  and  mortality  for 
certain  people  with  epilepsy.  Clinicians  should  be  familiar  with  the  characteristics  of  commercially  available 
devices  to  best  counsel  their  patients  on  whether  a  seizure  detection  device  may  be  beneficial  and  what  the 
optimal devices may be.   

1. Introduction 

Seizure detection devices could be invaluable tools for both people 
with epilepsy (PWE), their caregivers, and clinicians. For people with 
epilepsy, having a device that could alert caretakers to seizures would 
help  relieve  anxiety  from  the  helplessness  that  seizures  can  cause.  It 
could  also  potentially  reduce  the  risk  of  sudden  unexpected  death  in 
epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP affects 1 in 4500 children and 1 in 1000 adults 
per year [1] and the risk is increased up to 34-fold if someone shares a 
household  but  not  a  bedroom  or  up  to  82-fold  if  they  live  alone 
compared to PWE sharing a bedroom [2]. Most cases of SUDEP occur 
during sleep and terminal seizures are often unwitnessed. It is thought 
that if a caregiver is able to help immediately after a seizure they may 
interrupt the cascade of events that could have led to death or may be 
able to provide timely first aid [3,4]. Nocturnal supervision and the use 
of a nocturnal listening device could reduce SUDEP risk [1,5], however 
there is currently insufficient evidence that devices can prevent SUDEP 

[6], as these studies are difficult to perform. Alerting caretakers to sei-
zures can also reduce morbidity and mortality from injuries such as falls 
or  burns  or  allow  the  prompt  administration  of  rescue  mediations  to 
prevent  status  epilepticus  or  seizure  clusters  [7].  However,  utilizing 
these devices for safety requires a caregiver to be available and able to 
provide timely aid [8]. Most adults with epilepsy are single and social 
isolation is common [9]. In addition, it is possible that immediate aid is 
insufficient [10] and SUDEP has been reported in the absence of seizures 
[11]. 

For  clinicians,  seizure  detection  devices  can  be  an  important  tool 
because  self-reporting  of  seizures  is  unreliable  [12–14],  with  under- 
reporting of seizures, particularly in those with cognitive deficits from 
their epilepsy or anti-seizure medications or are amnestic to their sei-
zures.  Seizure  detection  devices  provide  objective  tracking  of  seizure 
frequency,  allowing  the  clinician  to  assess  response  to  therapy  and 
appropriately  adjust  medications.  Accurate  quantification  of  seizures 
would also be beneficial in clinical drug trials, which commonly use a

primary outcome of seizure frequency reduction. 

The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive and unbiased 
list of commercially available seizure detection devices and their char-
acteristics.  There  are  multiple types  of  seizure  detection devices  with 
different  sensors  and  detection  mechanisms.  The  optimal  seizure 
detection device for a particular person with epilepsy will depend on the 
main purpose of the device, personal preferences, age, and seizure type. 
Device development and new biosensors are advancing at a rapid rate 
and performance will continue to improve. The future of these devices 
will  likely  incorporate  seizure  prediction/forecasting  along  with 
detection. 

2. Methods 

We performed two systematic searches, one to identify commercially 
available seizure detection devices and a second to identify peer-review 
published  performance  data  on  commercially  available  seizure  detec-
tion devices. To identify seizure detection devices we utilized a diverse 
set of resources including PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, abstracts from the 
2nd International Congress on Mobile Devices and Seizure Detection in 
Epilepsy  2019,  and  websites  of  epilepsy  advocacy  organizations.  We 
searched  the  PubMed  database  for  English  language  full  text  articles 
published between Jan 1 2015 and Mar 31, 2021 using the following 
search terms “((seizure[Title/Abstract] OR convulsion[Title/Abstract]) AND
(detection[Title/Abstract] OR detector[Title/Abstract] OR detecting[Title/
Abstract])) AND (device[Title/Abstract] OR sensor[Title/Abstract] OR
biosensor[Title/Abstract] OR monitor[Title/Abstract] OR system[Title/Ab-
stract])”.  We  reviewed  abstracts  and  further  article  text  if  needed  to 
determine  if  a  commercially  available  seizure  detection  device  was 
utilized. From this PubMed search, we identified 11 review articles on 
seizure detection device performance [15–24] and references from these 
reviews were examined as well. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov database for 
condition epilepsy and search term seizure detection. We reviewed the 
community websites sudep.org, dannydid.org, epilepsy.org.uk, and epi 
lepsy.com.  Specifically,  for  epilepsy.com  we  additional  reviewed  the 
shark tank 2013–2020 winners (https://www.epilepsy.com/make-diffe 
rence/research-and-new-therapies/innovation/epilepsy-therapy-proje 
ct/shark-tank), epilepsy device-apedia database (https://www.epilepsy. 
com/deviceapedia-listing-page),  and  epilepsy pipeline  database  (https 
://www.epilepsy.com/pipeline-listing-page).  Once  a  commercially 
available  device  was  identified,  the  company  website  was  utilized  to 
obtain  information  about  the  device.  If  information  was  not  readily 
available,  the  company  was  contacted  to  obtain  the  necessary 

information. A device was excluded if it was not marketed for seizure 
detection or if there was no avenue for a consumer to purchase the de-
vice in US or Europe. To identify peer reviewed studies on performance 
data of commercially available devices, we used the PRISMA guidelines 
[25] and screened 728 publications obtained from PubMed and the re-
view  references  as  detailed  above  (Fig.  1).  Inclusion  and  exclusion 
criteria are detailed in Figs. 1 and 18 full text articles were identified and 
further reviewed. For devices with greater than one article, the article(s) 
with the highest phase of study design [26] were included. 9 articles 
with a lower phase of study design were excluded. This left 9 studies 
which  were  used  to  synthesize  performance  data.  Data  variables  that 
were  collected  from  each  article  included  sensitivity  for  each  seizure 
type  and  false  alarm  rate.  Confidence  intervals  were  obtained  if  pro-
vided. Due to the variability in reporting for false alarm rate, the number 
of alarms and hours of recording time were also collected and the false 
alarm was calculated as alarms per 24 hours. 

3. Observations 

3.1. Detection mechanisms 

There are multiple types of seizure detection devices ranging from 
movement  detectors  (accelerometers,  gyroscope,  magnetometer, 
piezoelectric  bed  sensors,  surface  electromyography  (EMG),  eye 
tracking,  video  monitors),  autonomic  change  detectors  (heart  rate/ 
pulse,  electrodermal  response,  temperature,  respiration,  oxygen  satu-
ration, blood pressure), and EEG based detectors (surface and implant-
able  intracranial  systems),  as  well  as  other  mechanisms  (audio,  near 
infrared spectroscopy). 

3.2. Commercially available devices 

There are currently 23 options for commercially available devices/ 
tools in the US or Europe (Table 1 and Table 2), however only 3 of these 
devices have regulatory approval (Embrace, SPEAC, Pulse Companion) 
and only 8 of these devices have peer reviewed published data on per-
formance (Fig. 1). The optimal device for a particular person with epi-
lepsy depends on the main purpose of the device, personal preferences, 
age, and seizure type. The options are divided into two broad categories: 
whether  they  are  designed  for  in-home  detection  (Table  1)  or  for 
ambulatory detection (both in the home and outside the home, Table 2). 
In-home  detection  devices  typically  utilize  a  mechanism  that  is  not 
portable  (e.g.,  video  sensor  or  bed  movement  sensor)  or  have  a  non-

of SUDEP. In-home detection devices can be used for a wider age range, 

and some even for infants (e.g., video sensors, bed movements sensors if 
the infant is above a certain weight, or the PulseGuard Mark II heart rate

control  unit  allowing  the  device  to  be  portable,  and  some  require  an 
internet connection which allows remote alerting of caregivers. These 
devices would be able to detect seizures anytime of the day and at any 
location and would be ideal for people with epilepsy who are more in-
dependent  and  may  at  times  be  alone  and  wish  to  alert  a  designated 
person that they are having a seizure. Some devices can even send GPS 
locations through the smartphone application. They would also be able 
to track the number of seizures, which would be particularly useful for 

accurate seizure counts, which a clinician can then use to guide medical 
decisions or a research team can use to assess an outcome for a clinical 
trial. And similar to in-home detection devices, they would be able to 
alert a family member/caretaker during a nocturnal seizure to reduce 
the risk of SUDEP. Some devices take advantage of existing consumer 
electronics such as smart phones and smart watches with accelerometers 
or heart rate detectors, which a person with epilepsy may already own. 
Ambulatory detection devices are typically designed for adults and may

not be adaptable for younger children or infants. Ambulatory detection 
devices  are  also  associated  with  higher  false  alarm  rates  related  to 
daytime activities, though most ambulatory detection devices allow the 
wearer to cancel a false alert. 

One  of  the  main  utilities  of  seizure  detection  devices  is  accurate 
seizure quantification for a clinician or a research team in a clinical trial. 
Two commercially  available devices have  been designed  for this pur-
pose, which include SPEAC, an ambulatory detection device using sur-
face EMG, and Nelli, an in-home detection device using video motion. 
These devices are used for a limited duration (ranging from weeks to 
months) to provide an accurate quantification of seizure activity over 
the duration of use. Nelli is also able to record audio-video and could aid 
in determining if paroxysmal events are seizures or not. Of note, since 
the writing of this article, SPEAC is no longer commercially available. 
Important preferences in choosing an optimal device include device 
cost, appearance, and comfort. Device cost range from a free application 
used with a smart phone or watch (seizure sync, seizario, epdetect) to 
high  up-front  costs  over  $1000  (epi-care  free/mobile,  epi-care  3000, 
nightwatch),  or  recurring  fees  (epi  night  nurse,  smartwatch  inspire, 
embrace 2, seizurelink). Device appearance and comfort depends on the 
detector location. For ambulatory detection devices, having a discreet, 
non-stigmatizing device is important for many people [27,28]. This has 
been a main barrier for the development of EEG or near-infrared spec-
troscopy based seizure detection devices which are typically worn on the 
head. 

Another  important  factor  to  consider  is  seizure  type.  Almost  all 
commercially available seizure detection devices have been designed to 
detect only  tonic-clonic  seizures.  The only exception currently  is Epi-
hunter which is designed for absence seizures. One device, Nightwatch 
can detect tonic-clonic and major motor seizures. However only eight 
devices  currently  have  peer-reviewed  published  data  on  performance 
[29–37] (Fig. 1), and only three of these devices have been evaluated 
prospectively in a natural environment. Performance data not evaluated 
in the natural environment should be interpreted cautiously. Taking this 
into  account,  wearable  devices  for  detecting  tonic  clonic  seizures  are 
able to achieve a sensitivity of greater than 90% (Fig. 1a). For SPEAC, if 
the device is properly placed, it can achieve a sensitivity of 100%. The 
bed  movement  sensors  (medpage  and  emfit)  had  a  lower  sensitivity 
(ranging from 11% to 63%). Emfit had better sensitivity in small pro-
spective  single  center  studies  [37–39]  but  a  recent  large  prospective 
natural  environment  study  reported  lower  performance  [32].  False 
alarm rate is more variable (Fig. 2b), but the majority of the devices had 
a rate of less than 1 per 24 h (with exception of Medpage and SPEAC). 
The  false  alarm  rate  is  an  important  consideration  and  the  tolerable 
threshold is variable between different people [40]. 

For the rest of the devices without peer reviewed published data on 
performance, it is unclear what their effectiveness is for detecting tonic- 
clonic  seizures,  and  this  is  important  to  emphasize  to  patients.  There 
may be indirect evidence supporting a specific detection mechanism, but 
the  commercially  available  detector  sensors  and  algorithms  may  be

different, and its effectiveness is unknown. Heart rate detector sensors 
rely on ictal tachycardia to detect seizures. Ictal tachycardia is common 
and  can  be  seen  in  82%  of  people  with  epilepsy  [41].  Recent  retro-
spective studies on ePatch [42,43], a heart rate detector under devel-
opment, detected ictal tachycardia in convulsive seizures with greater 
than 90% sensitivity and a FAR of less  than 1 alarm per  24 h. Video 
detectors  with  automated  video  analysis  has  also  been  shown  in  a 
retrospective study [44] to have 100% sensitivity and FAR of approxi-
mately 1.78 alarms per 24 h for convulsive seizures. 

There are several devices that have been shown to detect other sei-
zures types. Nightwatch, a multimodal device employing HR and 3-D 
accelerometry  for  in-home  detection,  was  tested  on  tonic  clonic  sei-
zures as well as other motor seizures such as tonic seizures, hypermotor 
seizures, and clustered myoclonic seizures in residental care facilities. It 
performed  reliably  in  a  prospective  natural  environment  study, 
achieving  an  86%  sensitivity  and  FAR  of  0.75  alarms  per  24  h  [32] 
(Fig. 1) compared to expert review of video. Other devices have not been 
able to show adequate performance for detecting motor seizures other 
than  tonic  clonic  seizures  [32,37,39].  No  device  has  been  shown  to 
prospectively  detect  non-convulsive  seizures.  For  non-convulsive 

seizures,  there  is  only  indirect  evidence  with  variable  performance. 
Autonomic changes do occur in some non-convulsive seizures, such as 
ictal  tachycardia, as  mentioned above,  or  other  cardiovascular, respi-
ratory,  or  electrodermal  changes.  These  changes  could  be  measured 
using EKG, oxygen saturation, or skin conductance. However, a recent 
review  article  found  that  unimodal  autonomic  algorithms  could  not 
reach  acceptable  performance  due  to  high  false  alarm  rates  [45]. 
However, recent retrospective studies on ePatch [42,43], a heart rate 
detector under development, was able to achieve a sensitivity of 85–90% 
and FAR of less than 1 alarm per 24 h in a select group of responders who 
had prominent heart rate changes during their non-convulsive seizures. 
45–58% of people with non-convulsive seizures were responders. 

3.3. Novel technologies 

There are many devices currently under development (Table 3) with 
a variety of detection mechanisms. Post-ictal apnea occurs with about 
20%  of all  generalized convulsive  seizures  [46] and  both  central and 
obstructive  apnea  following  convulsive  seizures  have  been  observed 
prior to death in several reports of SUDEP during video-EEG monitoring

[47–49]. An apnea detector would not detect seizures but could poten-
tially  alarm  for  impending  SUDEP.  Commercial  devices  are  currently 
available  to  alarm  for  impending  sudden  infant  death  syndrome  or 
sudden unexplained death in childhood (though no evidence exists that 
these devices can reduce risk or prevent death) and have been used by 
people with epilepsy with concerns of SUDEP. Examples include Neebo, 
which detects changes in heart rate, oxygenation, movement, and tem-
perature, and Owlet which detects changes in heart rate and oxygena-
tion,  and  Snuza  which  detects  breathing  movement,  as  well  as  many 
other devices. The Wearable Apnea Detection Device (WADD) [50] is 
reported under development for people with epilepsy. 

EEG  based  detectors  have  the  potential  to  detect  multiple  seizure 
types and development is underway for more discrete appearing devices 
[51–54],  which  range  from  ear  pieces,  to  headbands,  to  small  scalp 
adhesives. Multi-modal devices also have the capability to detect mul-
tiple seizure types with reduced false alarm rates. They utilize motion 
and  autonomic  change  sensors  with  some  combining  EMG,  EEG,  eye 
tracking, or video [55,56]. Multi-modal smart textiles (e.g. t-shirt) are 
under  development  which  can  measure  movement  and  autonomic 
changes  and  other  parameters.  Near  infrared  spectroscopy,  which 
measures cerebral oxygen saturation, could be useful in detecting the 
hemodynamic  changes  that  occur  in  the  brain  during  seizures  [57]. 
Audio based detectors could have the potential to pick up seizure related 
noises such as rhythmic sounds, disordered breathing, and ictal vocali-
zations [58]. Machine learning algorithms also have the potential to be 
personalized to an individual's seizure characteristics, improving accu-
racy and reducing false alarms [59–61]. 

3.4. Seizure forecasting and prediction 

A major area of epilepsy research is aimed at seizure forecasting and 
prediction [67,68], as the unpredictability of seizures is one of the most 
disabling aspects of epilepsy. Seizure prediction focuses on whether a 
seizure will occur or not, while seizure forecasting focuses on identifying 
the time periods when there is a high probability of seizure. Long term 
ambulatory recordings from RNS devices and ambulatory intracranial 
EEG  monitoring  devices  have  provided  evidence  that  seizures  and 
interictal epileptiform activity have a clear circadian or multi-day pat-
terns  [69–71].  Studies  using  seizure  diaries  have  also  shown  robust 
circadian  and  multi-day  patterns  [72,73].  There  is  even  a  subset  of 
people with epilepsy who can predict their own seizures up to 6 h prior 
using a diary and premonitory features [74]. And a recent study using 
seizure diary data to forecast low and high seizure states found that the 
data  was  predictive  in  50%  of  their  cohort  [73].  Thus  personalized 
seizure  forecasting  utilizing  data  from  seizure  detection  devices  will 
likely be a future advantage of these devices. In regards to seizure pre-
diction,  a  prospective  study  on  NeuroVista,  an  implanted  long  term 
ambulatory  intracranial  recording  device  [75],  has  found  that  it  is 
feasible. Pre-ictal heart rate increases have also been found in 36% of 
seizures, with a median onset 10.7 s prior to clinical or EEG signs [76]. 
Small case studies have also found pre-ictal hemodynamic changes using 
near-infrared spectroscopy [77–79]. Recent advances in biosensors and 
the ongoing development of multi-modal devices has now allowed for 
long-term ambulatory collection of EEG and other physiological data, 
which will advance the identification of the pre-ictal characteristics that 
can predict someone's next seizure. 

4. Conclusions 

Seizure  detection  devices  could  be  an  invaluable  tool  for  certain 
people with epilepsy. There are numerous devices commercially avail-
able with varying detection mechanisms and characteristics. Clinicians 
should be familiar with the devices available to best counsel their pa-
tient's on whether a seizure detection device may be beneficial and what 
the optimal devices may be. Patient's should be informed if performance 
data on the device is available or unknown. There are ongoing advances 

in biosensor technologies and algorithms that will continue to improve 
the performance of these devices. In the future, seizure forecasting and 
prediction may be a possibility.
