Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been ascribed  to cardiac  arrhythmia, possibly triggered by 
cerebral events. Young, noncompliant, substance-abusing males with convulsions  may be at risk. EEG/ECG 
studies  have  not  shown  significant cardiac  arrhythmias in  these  and  other  seizure  patients.  We  reviewed 
resting  ECGs  in  75  epilepsy patients  and  compared  ventricular rate,  PR  interval,  QRS  duration,  and  QT 
interval corrected for heart rate (QTC) with normal ECGs recorded in age-matched patients without cardiac or 
neurologic disorders.  No potentially lethal arrhythmias were noted in the seizure patients. Patients who fit the 
previously-described  profile of high risk of SUDEP had more abnormal ECGs and ventricular rate was faster in 
these patients than in other epileptics.  Patients with complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures  had 
faster ventricular rates than other epileptics.  No differences were noted in QRS duration or PR interval.  QT 
was longer in patients with complex partial seizures than in control ECGs or other epileptic  patients. 

These  findings  suggest  that  resting  ECG  has  low  diagnostic  yield in  epilepsy  patients  without  cardiac 
symptoms. The factors possibly predisposing  to SUDEP may relatively increase resting heart rate, however, 
and relatively increased  QT  interval  with complex partial  seizures  may indicate some  differences,  possibly 
neurally-mediated, in cardiac excitability which could contribute to SUDEP. 

Key words: epilepsy; seizures;  electrocardiogram;  arrhythmia; sudden death. 

INTRODUCTION 

SUBJECTS AND METHODS 

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) 
is an important problem in the management of 
seizure patients 1-3. Cardiac changes have been 
shown to develop in epilepsy and status epilep- 
ticus 4'5  and  neurogenic  pulmonary  oedema, 
acute  heart  failure  and  cerebrally-mediated 
cardiac  dysrhythmia  have  been  suggested  as 
causes  of  SUDEP 6-s.  Some  studies  indicate 
little  or  no  electrocardiographic  (ECG)  abnor- 
mality 
seizure  patients 9,  while  other 
studies 1°'11 have  found  ECG  differences,  par- 
ticularly involving the  QT  interval  which  is  a 
predicator  of  sudden  death 12.  We  reviewed 
ECGs  in  75  epilepsy  patients,  and  compared 
them to normal ECGs recorded in age-matched 
patients  without  cardiac  or  neurologic  dis- 
orders.

*  Presented  in  part  at  the  44th  Annual  Meeting,  American 
Epilepsy Society,  Philadelphia,  PA,  10 December 1991. 

Seventy-five patients had  12-lead ECGs  on ad- 
mission  to  the  Epilepsy  Unit  at  Ohio  State 
University  Hospital,  and  were  subsequently 
found  to  have  partial  or  generalized  seizures 
and  begun  on  appropriate  antiepileptic  drug 
regimens  with  no  subsequent  complications. 
They ranged in age from 20 to 64 years and had 
no  other  illnesses,  particularly  cardiovascular 
problems.  Fifty-one were  male  and  24  female. 
Fifty had  complex partial  seizures,  15  suffered 
partial  and  secondarily  generalized  seizures 
and  10  experienced  generalized  seizures.  Fifty 
of the  patients,  35  male  and  15  female,  had  a 
history  of  head  injury,  medication  noncom- 
pliance, mental illness, or  alcohol or substance 
abuse, factors  which have  been  said to  predis- 
pose  to  SUDEP 2'11. The  ECGs  of the  patients 
were  compared  to  retrieved  normal  ECGs  in 
patients matched for decade of age with respect 
to ventricular rate,  PR  interval,  QRS  duration 
and QT interval corrected for heart rate  (QTC).

RESULTS 

ECGs  in normal and  seizure patients are com- 
pared  in  Table  1.  No  significant  cardiac  dys- 
rhythm±as were noted  in  the  seizure patients' 
ECGs.  Ventricular  rate  was  faster  in  seizure 
patients  than  in  controls  (P  <  0.01),  and  the 
QTC was longer in those with epilepsy than in 
controls (P  <0.05).  These were not outside the 
normal  range,  however.  No  significant  differ- 
ences  were  found  in  the  PR  interval  or  QRS 
duration.  Complex  partial  and  secondarily 
generalized seizure patients had faster ventri- 
cular rates than patients with generalized epi- 
lepsy  (P  <  0.01).  PR  interval  was  shorter  and 
QRS duration less in the former group, but not 
significantly  so.  QTC  was  longer  in  patients 
with  partial  and  secondarily generalized seiz- 
ures  than  in  individuals with  generalized epi- 
lepsy (P <  0.01). 

DISCUSSION 

These  findings  suggest  that,  while  cardiac 
dysrhythmia may be rare and the resting ECG 
generally normal,  ECG  differences may  exist 
between people with epilepsy and normals and 
between complex partial  and  secondarily gen- 
eralized seizure patients and those with gener- 
alized epilepsy.  Resting ECGs  may be of little 
value in the assessment of seizure patients, but 
these differences may be relevant to the patho- 
genesis of SUDEP. 

Our  seizure patients  had  higher heart  rates 
than  controls,  and  patients  with  complex par- 
tial epilepsy or partial  seizures with secondary 
generalization  had  faster  ventricular  rates 
than  other seizure patients.  This may reflect a 
lower  level  of physical  fitness  among  seizure 
patients, or may be due to smoking, use of alco- 
hol or drugs, or anxiety effects of interictal be- 
havioural changes in seizure patients. Ant±epi- 
leptic  drugs  may have  cardiotonic effects, but 
our patients were off medication; the effects of 
other medications taken concomitantly cannot 
be  excluded.  The  normal  controls  may  also 
have been inadvertently selected for cardiovas- 
cular 
rates  among 
patients  with  epilepsy  may  nevertheless 
predispose to cardiac dysrhythmias.

We  found  no  difference  in  PR  interval  or 
QRS  duration  between  seizure  patients  and 
controls,  or  between patient  groups.  This  and

ing ECGs is in  accordance with the findings of 
Keilson et al. 9 that ECG abnormality is uncom- 
mon  in  seizure  patients.  Differences  of  QTC 
agree with  our  earlier findings that  QT  inter- 
val may be relatively prolonged in people with 
epilepsy 1°. It also accords with the observation 
of Earnest  et  al. 11,  who  found  QTC  prolonga- 
tion  in  patients  with  clinical  features  associ- 
ated  with  SUDEP.  Since  prolonged  QTC  may 
predict  sudden  cardiac  death 12,  this  suggests 
that  cerebral  influences or  medical factors as- 
sociated  with  epilepsy may prolong  QT  inter- 
val  and  predispose  to  cardiac  dysrhythmia, 
particularly in association with seizures. 

It  is  not  clear  why  partial  epilepsy  should 
have a  greater effect on QTC than generalized 
epilepsy. This could reflect an older partial epi- 
lepsy population, with subclinical cardiovascu- 
lar  effects of chronic  epilepsy.  Adult  patients 
with  partial  epilepsy  may  also  have  a  higher 
incidence  of  cardiovascular  risk  factors  than 
younger generalized seizure patients. 

It  i s possible that  chronic temporal lobe epi- 
lepsy may exert long-term effects on the heart 
through  effects  on  hypothalamic  and  brain 
stem centres, which may gradually prolong QT 
intervals  and  could  lead  to  sudden  cardiac 
events  during  seizures.  This  question  may  be 
settled by prospective cardiac studies in newly 
diagnosed seizure patients. These findings also 
suggest an aggressive approach to physical fit- 
ness  and  cardiac  risk  factors  in  epilepsy 
patients.
