ment of the infant. Neonatal seizures (NS) that frequently occur in the immature brain
may inﬂuence autonomic maturation and lead to detectable cardiovascular signs. These
autonomic manifestations can also have signiﬁcant diagnostic and prognostic value. The
analysis of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) represents the most used and feasible method to
evaluate cardiac autonomic regulation. This narrative review summarizes studies investi-

utility of HRV measures for seizure detection and management. While HRV analysis in criti-

enhance the ability to better diagnose seizures in the clinical setting. We present poten-
tial applications of the analysis of HRV, which could have a useful future role, beyond the

Introduction

The perinatal period is a critical time for the development of
a healthy nervous system that can meet internal and envi-
ronmental demands in adulthood. The central autonomic
network (CAN) in particular, as well as the parasympathetic
and sympathetic peripheral systems, goes through a pro-
longed maturation period before reaching an advanced level

R. Statello, L. Carnevali, A. Sgoifo et al.

of control of vital functions. This process may be affected by
various factors, potentially leading to delayed or dysfunc-
tional autonomic maturation [49]. The occurrence of seiz-
ures may play an important
role in this context.
Signiﬁcantly, several autonomic changes have been recog-
nized as seizure manifestations in newborns, and the Inter-
national League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has
recently
presented a novel classiﬁcation for neonatal seizures (NS),
where “autonomic seizures” are deﬁned as electro-clinical
events that can involve cardiovascular, pupillary, gastroin-
testinal, sudomotor, vasomotor, thermoregulatory and respi-
ratory changes [58]. However, autonomic changes observed
in neonates with seizures may also be secondary to a more
general condition of autonomic immaturity. For instance,
autonomic cardiac signs (e.g., bradycardia) may be related
to apnea and an immature control of breathing rather than
directly due to seizures. Accordingly, when critically ill new-
borns are monitored for suspected seizures, a critical assess-
ment of autonomic features is advised, as suggested by
Falsaperla and his colleagues, commenting on the ﬁrst draft
of the new ILAE neonatal seizure classiﬁcation (for the web
reference, please see the end of the reference list). Indirect
assessment of cardiac autonomic activity via analysis of
heart rate variability (HRV) appears to be the most suitable
way to achieve this goal. Speciﬁcally, HRV analysis provides
relevant information about autonomic input to the heart
[68, 77] and has multiple research and clinical applications
due to its non-invasive nature and the availability of easy-
to-use software tools. However, despite a large number of
HRV studies that have been published over the last thirty
years in clinical and non-clinical populations, there is still a
paucity of HRV data from newborns with NS and it is now
timely that the potential applications of HRV analysis are
examined also in this clinical context. Starting from the rela-
tionship between the CAN and seizures, this narrative review
discusses recent HRV ﬁndings from neonates with NS with
the aim of highlighting the clinical value of HRV derived
information and the potential contribution of HRV analysis in
NS management. Finally, the difﬁculties of using HRV analy-
sis in this patient group are discussed.

Central autonomic network and seizures

The CAN was ﬁrst described as a large network that controls
efferent information relayed to the heart and involves corti-
cal, subcortical (forebrain) and brain stem regions [4].
Within this network, higher interconnected cortical regions,
including the orbitofrontal, insular and cingulate cortex,
process afferent signals from other brain areas and the
periphery, and project to pivotal subcortical structures, like
the amygdala and hypothalamus [78, 16]. The former modu-
lates the effects of emotional stimuli on the heart and is
connected with hypothalamic and brain stem nuclei [72].
The hypothalamus, in turn, integrates the forebrain control
of autonomic function sending projections to key autonomic
structures within the brainstem (periaqueductal gray mat-
ter, parabrachial region, rostral ventrolateral medulla,
raphe pallidus, the nucleus tractus solitarius, among others)
[16, 64]. Therefore, a complex of higher neural inﬂuences
descends in a cascade fashion and ultimately reaches sympa-
thetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons that

modulate cardiac function via the peripheral arms of the
autonomic nervous system [72].

Disorganized electrical discharges within the brain, and
speciﬁcally within the CAN, can thus affect cardiac auto-
nomic function [19]. In patients with epilepsy, autonomic
dysfunction frequently occurs during seizures, which may
elicit detectable cardiovascular changes [10, 57]. For exam-
ple, transient changes in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate
(HR) are some of the most common autonomic manifesta-
tions of seizures in the neonatal period [57, 94]. Moreover,
cardiac manifestations of seizures that range from sinus
tachycardia to atrial or ventricular ﬁbrillation have been
reported in both children and adults [50, 89, 72, 3]. A retro-
spective study identiﬁed tachycardia and oxygen desatura-
tion (from 60 s before electrographic seizure onset to 60 s
after seizure offset) as the most common autonomic peri‑ic-
tal signs observed in 49 children with temporal lobe seizures
[95]. Post-ictal bradycardia is a less common cardiac sign of
seizures, which, in children, could be related to syncope
[37] and secondary to severe hypoxemia induced by central
apnea. Severe bradycardia may progress to asystole and
thus represent a potential underlying mechanism of sudden
death associated with seizures [5, 48, 84]. Seizures within
the insular cortex have been associated with cardiac repo-
larization abnormalities (e.g., long QT, larger QT dispersion)
that may result from reduced inhibition of sympathetic
activity and increased release of catecholamines, and trig-
ger serious arrhythmias and sudden death [76]. Notably,
both tachy- and brady-arrhythmias have been described dur-
ing and/or after different types of seizures. Cortical stimula-
tion studies of the anterior insula [51, 52, 53], have shown
evidence that electrical discharges arising from the right
hemisphere produce cardiac effects driven by the sympa-
thetic nervous system, whilst seizures arising from the left
result in parasympathetic effects. Furthermore, a recent
study suggests that bi-temporal seizure activity may signiﬁ-
cantly increase heart rate [54]. Higher mortality risk has
been associated with post-ictal rather than ictal arrhyth-
mias, suggesting that seizures may trigger life-threatening
cardiac events [89].

Curiously, seizures have been also reported following
cardiac surgery in newborns, the mechanisms of which
have not yet been fully elucidated [15]. No link to CAN
dysregulation has been demonstrated, but cerebral anoxia
may be involved. For example, as early as 1999, a case
study described the onset of seizures following sudden
cerebral anoxia in a newborn with congenital atrio-ven-
tricular block and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [38].
Nevertheless, seizures secondary to cerebral anoxia are
very common in newborns and, thus, a link to the CAN
remains elusive.

Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that the CAN is a
critical neural substrate involved in the generation of sei-
zure-related cardiac complications that,
in turn, may
worsen post-hypoxic brain damage and contribute to seizure
onset [12] (Fig. 1). Several alterations of cardio-respiratory
autonomic function (e.g.,
severe bradycardia, central
apnea, dysregulation of blood pressure control with
impaired baroreﬂex sensitivity) can indeed compromise sys-
temic or cerebral blood ﬂow and oxygen supply. The resul-
tant hypoxemia could thus induce the progression of brain
injury underlying seizures.

Fig. 1
Neonatal seizures and central autonomic network (CAN). Seizures can result in altered autonomic regulation of vital func-
tions. In turn, these autonomic changes may actually play a role in seizure onset, especially when pre-existing damage (e.g., ischemic
hypoxia) affects the immature brain.

Furthermore, it should be highlighted that the neonatal
condition represents a period of extreme vulnerability. The
complex interconnections between hindbrain, midbrain,
and forebrain structures of the CAN begin to develop during
the intrauterine phase and strengthen throughout life. Simi-
larly, the peripheral autonomic nervous system develops
during the fetal period and matures during the ﬁrst years of
life, when increased cortical development allows better
control over the brainstem via direct (e.g., corticobulbar)
and indirect (e.g., corticoreticular) neural pathways, and a
simultaneous increase in myelinated vagal ﬁbers number
leads to a new balance promoting parasympathetic over
sympathetic activity [49]. During the third trimester of preg-
nancy in particular, an acceleration in autonomic maturation
occurs that is associated with an important increase in vagal
tone [67]. However, the intense synaptogenesis and develop-
mental mechanisms, including rapid microglia activation
[40], in addition to the pronounced excitability of the imma-
ture brain [57], enhance seizure susceptibility in response to
external insults. This might be exacerbated when preterm
birth causes a premature transition from the intra- to extra-
uterine environment. Nevertheless, the higher
risk of
experiencing NS in preterm babies is strongly associated
with illness (e.g., intraventricular hemorrhage) [73]. In addi-
tion, the well-known developmental gap in cardiac auto-
nomic control between preterm and full-term infants at
birth persists at the time of their expected delivery, and
seems to resolve only at age two if no further complications
occur [17]. Accordingly, preterm babies could be more likely
to show seizure-related autonomic signs and future adverse
outcomes [73, 35, 97].

Cardiac autonomic function and HRV

HRV analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in neo-
nates provides a useful method of evaluating cardiac auto-
nomic regulation in a non-invasive and indirect manner, for
the investigation of the cardiac autonomic correlates of NS.
HRV describes the oscillation in the interval between conse-
cutive normal heartbeats (RR intervals) and, thus, the con-
tinuous HR ﬂuctuations around the mean value [79]. This

phenomenon is mainly driven by the activity of higher auto-
nomic control centers coupled with peripheral feedback
mechanisms and intrinsic sinoatrial node dynamics, which
modulate the rhythmicity of the cardiac pacemaker [88].
Importantly, HR shows periodic respiratory-related changes.
This phenomenon, in which HR increases during inspiration
and decreases during expiration, is known as respiratory
sinus arrhythmia and it is closely related to vagal tone [39].

HRV is generally investigated through linear methods in
the time- or frequency-domain (see table 1 for a summary of
the main HRV parameters in newborns), although non-linear
methods have also been used for this purpose. For time-
domain analysis, geometrical patterns and many statistical
indices can be derived from direct RR interval measurements
or the differences between RR intervals [79, 41]. Among
these indices, the most routinely used are: the standard
deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) that reﬂects all the cyclic
components responsible for variability; and the root mean
square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD), which
describes short-term variation in heart rate and thus esti-
mates the vagal input to the heart [79]. For frequency-
domain, spectral analysis of interbeat interval time series
indicates the distribution of absolute or relative power as a
function of frequency [79]. Both parametric and non-
parametric procedures can be used for estimating power
spectral density, but the latter, based on the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) algorithm, are often preferred. Indeed,
although it requires a stationary data segment of a minimum
length and needs artiﬁcial interpolation, FFT ensures faster
and easier calculation of the power spectral density. On the
contrary, autoregressive parametric methods, which provide
high-resolution spectra, are computationally demanding and
need a careful evaluation of the chosen model and its order
[43]. The power spectrum of short-term time series contains
three major components: i) the high frequency (HF) compo-
nent, which is related to respiration and reﬂects cardiac
vagal tone [82]; ii) the low frequency (LF) component, which
includes both sympathetic and vagal inﬂuences and is associ-
ated with baroreceptor activity [98]; and iii) the very low
frequency (VLF) component, which is less deﬁned and seems
to be related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,
thermoregulation and the peripheral vasomotor tone [91].

The HF and LF components (usually reported as absolute val-
ues, ms2) can also be expressed in normalized units (n.u.),
which represent the relative proportion of each component
of the total power (TP) minus the VLF component [11].
Lastly, the ratio between LF and HF (LF/HF) was long used as
a marker of sympathovagal balance, although this concept
has been extensively challenged [8]. In fact, given that the
LF band does not reﬂect sympathetic activity [28, 59, 36],
there is now a consensus to say that the precise physiological
underpinnings of the LF/HF ratio are still unclear [42].
Finally, although complex techniques based on nonlinear
dynamics and chaos theory have been developed to evaluate
in greater detail the intrinsic complexity of HRV, these tools
require more powerful computing and are still under devel-
opment and evaluation.

HRV ﬁndings in newborns with NS

Despite the use of HRV as a proxy for cardiac autonomic
function in several clinical and investigational domains,
there is a paucity of data about HRV features in newborns
with seizures. The majority of these ﬁndings comes from
studies conducted on newborns with hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE), the most frequent etiology of NS.
For example, a retrospective study of ECG recordings from
term HIE newborns related the location of cerebral injury
to a decrease or increase in the LF/HF ratio, depending
upon the hemispheric lateralization of focal brain injuries
revealed by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A
multiple linear regression model was used to relate location
of injury to spectral features of HRV extracted from 20-min
seizure-free ECG recordings. The authors found that lesions
of the right cerebral cortex and right cerebellum were
associated with decreased LF/HF ratio, whereas damage to
corresponding regions of the left hemisphere were associ-
ated with increased LF/HF ratio. However, these ﬁndings,
which may indicate autonomic lateralization in term

newborns, were not conﬁrmed when HF (0.3(cid:1)1 Hz) and LF
(0.05(cid:1)0.25 Hz) spectral powers were considered sepa-
rately. Also, because the brain was divided into 13 areas to
score injury sites, possible interregional inﬂuences and the
involvement of more restricted areas may not have been
detected [66]. Goulding et al. [30] compared HRV in normo-
thermic and hypothermic newborns with different EEG
grades of HIE severity (i.e., mild, moderate and severe).
For each patient, 1 h epochs were selected at 6, 12, 24,
36, 48, and 72 h after birth and those with poor ECG qual-
ity, as well as with seizure activity, were excluded. Time-
domain parameters were calculated and modiﬁed fre-
quency bands (HF, 0.2(cid:1)2 Hz; and LF, 0.04(cid:1)0.2 Hz) were
applied for HRV spectral analysis. The authors found that
HRV inversely correlated with HIE severity in full-term new-
borns and that therapeutic hypothermia enhanced HF-HRV
with a putative neuroprotective effect in babies with mod-
erate HIE [30]. Similarly, Vesoulis et al. [93] evaluated the
effect of therapeutic hypothermia on HRV in two groups of
full-term neonates with favorable and unfavorable out-
comes based on the occurrence of seizures, abnormal MRI
ﬁndings and neurodevelopmental impairment. Sixty minute
segments were selected during hypothermia (at 24 and
48 h) and normothermia (at 96 h). Adapted frequency
bands (HF, 0.5(cid:1)1.3 Hz; and LF, 0.04(cid:1)0.5 Hz) and time-
domain measures were considered. An increase over time
was observed for HR and its variability in babies with favor-
able outcomes, suggesting a gradual improvement in car-
diac autonomic control that, according to the authors,
could be independent of hypothermia. Indeed, temperature
conditions affected HR in both groups, whereas an effect on
breathing rate and HF spectral power was detected only in
patients with favorable outcomes. Therefore, the authors
concluded that the underlying brain injury produced persis-
tent changes in HRV, whereas hypothermia induced mild
bradycardia in infants with moderate HIE. However, the
potential inﬂuence of anticonvulsant drug administration in
critically ill infants on HRV was not considered [93].

A representative power spectrum of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in a newborn. An HRV spectral estimate has been obtained
through the application of the Fast Fourier Transform method on a 3-min ECG recording. The respiratory sinus arrhythmia peak occurs
at 0.73 Hz (»44 breaths per minute).

Recently, a meta-analysis was attempted on 1187 studies
involving 248 neonates. As stated by the authors, very high
heterogeneity among these studies allowed only a narrative
description of four observational studies (including the work
by Goulding et al. [30] described above) showing that HRV
indices were reduced in newborns with moderate or severe
HIE compared to neonates with mild or no HIE [1]. However,
a critical aspect to consider is that these studies did not fully
address HRV changes during NS, but predominantly focused
on the association between HRV and HIE during seizure-free
periods.

As a ﬁrst attempt to ﬁll this knowledge gap, a retrospec-
tive study conducted by our group reported that newborns
with NS showed lower resting state HRV compared to
matched controls. Moreover, a short-lasting increase in para-
sympathetic indices of HRV was observed during seizures
only in full-term newborns. We hypothesized that this effect
could be due to the relatively advanced degree of matura-
tion of the autonomic nervous system in full-term neonates,
and we have interpreted it as a potential protective mecha-
nism aimed at limiting sympathetic hyperactivity [74].

Potential application of HRV in seizure
detection

The studies reviewed so far have limited their investigation
to the description of the HRV changes that occur in neonatal
patients during both seizures and seizure-free periods. How-
ever, another intriguing area of research would be the inves-
tigation of the extent to which HRV measures may inform
about the onset and/or severity of seizure activity. A study
reporting a decrease in RR intervals during NS suggested
that signiﬁcant changes in HR might alert the clinicians to
the occurrence of subclinical events [32]. However, another
work reporting a low occurrence of ictal HR variations indi-
cated that these changes seemed to be insensitive for
detecting seizures in neonates with severe birth asphyxia
[13]. Recently, artiﬁcial
intelligence has been widely
employed in the context of cardiac bioelectrical signal

analysis [14, 7]. A number of authors have proposed methods
for the early detection or prediction of seizures based on
time and frequency features of HRV [33, 34, 20, 22, 44, 45,
46]. For instance, machine learning based approaches
focused on quantiﬁcation analysis via Supporting Vector
Machine (SVM) have been proposed to predict neonatal seiz-
ures [80]. However, a thorough delineation of these algo-
rithms that, in some cases, reached promising speciﬁcity
and sensibility values but remain outside the routine clinical
practice, is beyond the scope of this review. (For a review of
automatic seizure detection methods see [60]).

As far as NS detection is concerned, electroencephalogra-
phy (EEG) represents the fundamental examination. How-
ever, EEG alone may miss seizures which do not involve
cortical regions. In these cases (e.g., in a preterm newborn
with autonomic seizures originating from limbic structures)
evaluating autonomic signs could be very helpful. Therefore,
rather than the easier and time-saving amplitude integrated
EEG (aEEG) [29] or conventional EEG, continuous long-term
video-EEG (multiple channel v-EEG) must be used whenever
possible [63, 69, 70]. Speciﬁcally, multiple channel v-EEG
allows for evaluation of electrooculogram (EOG), electro-
myogram (EMG), ECG, breathing rate and other respiratory
measures in addition to both electroencephalographic pat-
terns and behavioral manifestations. Consequently, auto-
nomic features of NS can be investigated in depth, leading
to better seizure detection and characterization.

The main difﬁculties of HRV assessment in
newborns with seizures

Currently, the investigation of HRV dynamics in newborns
with seizures is not without limitations. For instance, the
relatively small number of patients included in each study
(e.g., n = 16, [93]; n = 28, [74], 2018; n = 40, [66]; n = 118
[30]) could affect results and conclusions. Since this is pri-
marily due to difﬁculties in recruiting good quality ECG
recordings, using animal models or computer simulations of
NS could be a viable strategy to overcome this problem

487

R. Statello, L. Carnevali, A. Sgoifo et al.

depending on the aims of the study. Moreover, when consid-
ering the methodological heterogeneity of these studies (e.
g., inclusion criteria, modality of analysis and indices calcu-
lated, experimental design, etc.) that may also derive from
their retrospective nature, comparison of results between
studies is challenging. It is known that sampling frequency,
recording period length, RR detection and artifact removal
methods are just some of the factors that can inﬂuence HRV
assessment [68, 79]. In addition, several characteristics of
newborns with NS should be taken into account. Besides sex
and health status (e.g., the occurrence of primary brain con-
ditions; Apgar score; cerebral ultrasound evaluation; etc.),
heart and respiration rates may affect proper computation
of HRV. As a rule, variability decreases when RR intervals get
shorter [47], and a reduction in respiratory rate increases
the amplitude of HR oscillations [8]. Accordingly, healthy
newborns whose normal HR is higher than 90 beats per min-
ute (bpm) show lower HRV than children and adults [61].
Moreover, their respiration rate is about 50 breaths/min and
therefore respiratory sinus arrhythmia peak is around 0.8 Hz
(Fig. 2). For these reasons, frequency bands recommended
for adult population (VLF < 0.04 Hz < LF < 0.15 Hz < HF <
0.4 Hz) are not suitable for HRV spectral analysis in infants
[26]. Consequently, in order to use more appropriate spec-
tral bands, many authors have employed different frequency
ranges adapted from the Task Force guidelines (e.g., 0.05 Hz
< LF < 0.25 Hz and 0.3 < HF < 1 Hz, [66]), leading to results
that are not comparable between studies. The gestational
and post natal age of newborns must also be taken into
account. Maturation of autonomic control starts in the fetus,
and continues for many years. Accordingly, preterm infants
have lower HRV than full-term babies [97]. Several authors
have also suggested that postnatal autonomic maturation
may differ between pre- and full-term infants at least for
the ﬁrst two years of life [17]. Another issue to consider is
that HRV investigations use different time lengths of
selected ECG recordings in newborns. It is well established
that HRV is affected by the length of analyzed epochs and its
parameters give different information when they are calcu-
lated from ultra-short-, short-term or 24-hour period [42,
79]. Govindan et al. have recently proposed that a 2-min
period could represent the optimal epoch length to analyze
RR interval variability in ill infants. Indeed, HRV dynamics of
newborns can be more accurately characterized using a
short epoch length of data because of their higher HR com-
pared to children and adults, for which analyzing a 5-min
period is recommended [31]. Furthermore, based on their
relation to a given seizure event, several periods within the
acquired recordings can be deﬁned as follows: pre-ictal
(immediately before seizure); ictal (during a seizure); post-
ictal (immediately after seizure); or inter-ictal (between
and far from seizure events) [24, 74]. Therefore, one or
more periods can be selected and analyzed, according to
the speciﬁc purpose of the study. However, mainly (but not
exclusively) due to the type and duration of seizure, accu-
rately deﬁning the boundaries of each period remains chal-
lenging and could require a thorough EEG evaluation [56].
Lastly, many other potential confounding factors (e.g., drug
administration, behavioral state, etc.) can result from study
design and/or clinical setting. Therefore, their inﬂuence on
HRV assessment should be taken into account.

HRV dynamics and sleep in newborns

Undoubtedly, besides the above reported confounding fac-
tors, the evaluation of sleep and waking states deserves a
separate discussion, since physiological functions are dra-
matically affected by different behavioral states.

Cardiac autonomic changes occur during sleep. Speciﬁ-
cally, in healthy adults, different sleep stages are character-
ized by different sympathovagal regulatory patterns. A
predominant sympathetic activity can be observed during
REM sleep, whereas vagal modulation characterizes the
NREM phase and prevails especially during deep sleep [85,
86]. A more complex picture results from several studies
describing HRV dynamics during sleep in newborns. Doyle
et al. provided normative time- and frequency-domain data
for healthy full-term neonates during quiet and active sleep
in the ﬁrst 12 h of life. Speciﬁcally, 30 babies with mature
sleep-wake cycles were studied and signiﬁcant between-
states differences in HRV measures were found. Vagal tone
was dominant in quiet sleep as suggested by HF power. How-
ever, time-domain indices of parasympathetic tone (i.e.,
RMSSD and PNN25 (percentage of successive NN intervals
that differ by more than 25 ms)) did not signiﬁcantly differ
between the two sleep phases, probably because these
parameters could not be appropriate to quantify HF activity
during quiet sleep. Moreover, the HF respiratory peak was
missing in 6 newborns during quiet sleep. The authors sug-
gested that immature cardiorespiratory control could lead
to the lack of respiratory sinus arrhythmia peak, but an arti-
ﬁcial loss of this peak could also be due to “cardiac aliasing”
[21, 62]. These ﬁndings conﬁrmed that neonatal HRV is
strongly inﬂuenced by sleep state and the degree of matura-
tion of
system, as previously
described elsewhere. In 1993, a study by Eiselt et al. [23]
showed that full-term newborns had lower HR and higher
HRV than pre-term neonates of the same postconceptional
age (i.e., 37(cid:1)41 weeks) during both quiet and active sleep.
Furthermore, lower HR and higher amplitude of HF charac-
terized quiet sleep as compared to active sleep but only in
full-term newborns. Presumably, the pronounced immaturity
of the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous
system concealed this difference between sleep states in
preterm babies [23]. Vandeput et al. reported signiﬁcantly
lower HR and SDNN in non-REM than in REM sleep of preterm
neonates at 34 weeks’ postconceptional age. The authors
suggested the use of nonlinear methods that revealed a less
chaotic RR interval series during NREM sleep periods to dis-
criminate between neonates with and without abnormal pol-
ysomnography ﬁndings [90]. Moreover, some factors could
inﬂuence HRV independent of the sleep stages. For instance,
Stephan-Blanchard et al. showed that non-neutral ambient
temperature affects autonomic regulation in sleeping pre-
term babies and warm thermal conditions are associated
with lower vagally mediated HRV, independently of the sleep
stage [75]. Some studies demonstrated that even sleeping
position affects newborns’ HRV that is reduced by prone
sleeping, independent of gestational age [71, 25].

the autonomic nervous

The sleep cycle in newborns differs quite dramatically
compared with adults. Currently, polysomnographic and
behavioral evaluations allow the identiﬁcation of ﬁve
main neonatal sleep-wake states: “active sleep”; “quiet

sleep”; “active wakefulness”; “quiet wakefulness”; and
“indeterminate sleep”. Except for the indeterminate sleep,
these states are marked by several physiological and behav-
ioral features (e.g., active sleep are characterized by rapid
eye movements, irregular cardiorespiratory patterns, con-
tinuous EEG background activity and facial movements,
whereas regular cardiorespiratory patterns, dis- or semi-
continuous EEG background activity and lack of movements
are typical of quiet sleep) that differs according to gesta-
tional age [18]. Indeed, immature sleep states appear after
24 weeks of gestational age [65, 92]. As vigilance states
mature (with active sleep that appears ﬁrst, followed by
quiet sleep, active wakefulness and, lastly, quiet wakeful-
ness), the time spent in the indeterminate state decreases.
However, mature and recognizable states occur only near
term, when the sleep cycle amounts to » 60 min and a clear
ultradian rhythm can be observed [9]. Importantly, the mat-
uration of the wake-sleep cycle is thought to indicate brain
integrity and cortical organization, but also to take an active
part in the development, as well as in the consolidation, of
cerebral functions [9, 87]. Preterm birth as well as various
postnatal factors and comorbidities can have an unfavorable
impact on sleep maturation (e.g., in HIE and other condi-
tions, sometimes it is impossible to assess the occurrence of
different sleep phases) and may lead to impaired neurologi-
cal functions [27]. It is particularly important for newborns
with seizures that can be premature, have serious underly-
ing conditions and undergo various therapeutic treatments.
There is currently little agreement on preterm EEG scoring
due to the lack of deﬁnitive guidelines. Nevertheless, it is
acknowledged that appropriate identiﬁcation and evalua-
tion of behavioral state are fundamental for carrying out
any neurophysiological investigation, including HRV assess-
ment, in the neonatal period and particularly in at-risk neo-
nates.

Perspectives and limitations

Despite a paucity of data about HRV measures as a proxy of
cardiac autonomic function in newborns with NS, several
potential applications of HRV emerge from the available lit-
erature. Firstly, HRV analysis give information about seizure
burden. Furthermore, since cardiac autonomic changes dur-
ing seizure may depend on which brain areas are involved,
HR and HRV dynamics could provide relevant information
about the ictal onset area, propagation and severity of seiz-
ures [83]. HRV measures have also been proposed as possible
prognostic markers of neurological underlying injury (e.g.,
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) in newborns, as sug-
gested in a recent review [6]. Moreover, in order to make
precision medicine even more feasible in critically ill new-
borns and since genetic testing currently plays an important
role in the management of NS with genetic etiology [2],
correlating HRV-derived autonomic features with speciﬁc
pathological mutations represents an intriguing clinical chal-
lenge. Similarly, the development of novel HRV-based algo-
rithms and tools for automatic seizures detection remains an
ambitious and promising research topic. However, although
HRV analysis can provide supplemental information for EEG-
based diagnosis, NS cannot be diagnosed with HRV analysis
alone. Despite the progress made to date, it is still not

feasible to use HRV parameters as predictive/diagnostic
markers of NS, since many differences exist between differ-
ent newborns with NS and this could require previous indi-
vidualized characterizations. Fetal HRV that may be
informative of fetal maturation level and the possible occur-
rence of injuries could also be useful in this respect [55, 81,
96]. Certainly, HRV measures can provide important infor-
mation about the impact of different therapies for NS on
cardiac autonomic activity and maturation.

Conclusion

Newborns may show impaired autonomic cardiovascular
function during an episode of seizures and seizure-free peri-
ods, which might be indicative of a compromised neurovege-
tative maturation or possible multiorgan failure. However,
for the suggested HRV applications and future purposes, it is
pivotal to deﬁne standard guidelines for HRV analysis in new-
borns, with appropriate corrections for pre-term babies.
Indeed, the wide availability of easily accessible HRV-dedi-
cated software represents a valuable opportunity but also a
dangerous shortcut that could lead to result misinterpreta-
tion and hasty conclusions especially when non-speciﬁc
indexes (e.g., LF/HF) are reported and/or their interpreta-
tion is oversimpliﬁed. In conclusion, HRV analysis represents
a powerful research tool that supplies valuable insights into
the cardiac autonomic regulation of newborns. Further stud-
ies are needed to fully elucidate HRV dynamics in neonates
with seizures and, although the clinical applications of HRV
for NS detection and management may appear attractive, it
is advisable to remain cautious about their practical feasibil-
ity at present in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) clinical
settings.
