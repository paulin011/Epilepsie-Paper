Abstract

Background and Objectives
To examine the preferences and user experiences of people with epilepsy and caregivers
regarding automated wearable seizure detection devices.

Methods
We performed a mixed-methods systematic review. We searched electronic databases for
original peer-reviewed publications between January 1, 2000, and May 26, 2021. Key search
terms included “epilepsy,” “seizure,” “wearable,” and “non-invasive.” We performed a de-
scriptive and qualitative thematic analysis of the studies included according to the technology
acceptance model. Full texts of the discussion sections were further analyzed to identify word
frequency and word mapping.

Results
Twenty-two observational studies were identiﬁed. Collectively, they comprised responses from
3,299 participants including patients with epilepsy, caregivers, and healthcare workers. Sixteen
studies examined user preferences, 5 examined user experiences, and 1 examined both expe-
riences and preferences. Important preferences for wearables included improving care, cost,
accuracy, and design. Patients desired real-time detection with a latency of ≤15 minutes from
seizure occurrence, along with high sensitivity (≥90%) and low false alarm rates. Device-related
costs were a major factor for device acceptance, where device costs of <$300 USD and a
monthly subscription fee of <$20 USD were preferred. Despite being a major driver of
wearable-based technologies, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy was rarely discussed.
Among studies evaluating user experiences, there was a greater acceptance toward wristwatches.
Thematic coding analysis showed that attitudes toward device use and perceived usefulness
were reported consistently. Word mapping identiﬁed “speciﬁcity,” “cost,” and “battery” as key
single terms and “battery life,” “insurance coverage,” “prediction/detection quality,” and the
eﬀect of devices on “daily life” as key bigrams.

Discussion
User acceptance of wearable technology for seizure detection was strongly inﬂuenced by
accuracy, design, comfort, and cost. Our ﬁndings emphasize the need for standardized and
validated tools to comprehensively examine preferences and user experiences of wearable
devices in this population using the themes identiﬁed in this study. Greater eﬀorts to in-
corporate perspectives and user experiences in developing wearables for seizure detection,
particularly in community-based settings, are needed.

Trial Registration Information
PROSPERO Registration CRD42020193565.

Management of epilepsy and clinical evaluation of novel
therapies relies on accurate reporting of seizures. Currently,
this is ascertained through subjective reporting from patients
and/or caregivers. Subjective reporting is often inaccurate
because patients have limited awareness or recollection of
their seizures.1,2 Objective methods for seizure detection such
as wearable devices and integration of mobile health platforms
hold promise for high-quality and real-time seizure monitor-
ing, which may improve out-of-hospital, community-based
care.

Many patients with epilepsy are reliant on family members or
caregivers for assistance in managing their condition, which in
turn aﬀect their autonomy and privacy.3 People with epilepsy,
particularly those who have poor control of their seizures, are
more likely to come from a low socioeconomic background
and face diﬃculties with driving and employment.4 In addi-
tion, there are often substantial stigma, anxiety, and de-
pression associated with epilepsy. Therefore, it is essential to
include the views, experiences, and desires of patients with
epilepsy, their caregivers, and treating clinicians in the de-
velopment and implementation of
seizure monitoring
technologies.

However, previous reviews of patient needs and preferences
for wearable devices for epilepsy have not applied a systematic
methodology5 or examined broad neurologic disorders.6
Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize the
needs, preferences, and experiences of people with epilepsy,
caregivers, and healthcare providers using a prepublished
systematic protocol and undertaking both descriptive analysis
and thematic coding of the included studies.

Methods

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations,
and Patient Consents
The protocol for this review was developed and prospectively
registered on the PROSPERO (International Prospective
Register of Systematic Reviews; CRD42020193565, July 22,
2020) in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.7

Identification of Studies
Electronic database searches were conducted through
PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library

(January 1, 2000, to May 26, 2021). Searches were conducted
in the English language without study design or setting re-
strictions to identify studies reporting perspectives of patients
with epilepsy, caregivers of patients with epilepsy, or clinicians
involved in epilepsy care on user preferences, needs, and
desires or experiences of patients with epilepsy in using
noninvasive and ambulatory devices intended for seizure
monitoring. We excluded studies that evaluated invasive or
nonambulatory devices.

Selection of Studies
Two reviewers (S.S., A.Y., or A.B.) independently screened
titles and abstracts and reviewed full texts using Covidence
(Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia);
disagreements for
inclusion were resolved with an in-
dependent reviewer (P.K.).

Study Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment
Two reviewers (S.V., L.P., or N.A.L.) conducted a quality
review of all included articles using the Joanna Briggs Institute
critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional or cohort studies
and the Critical Appraisal Skills Program for qualitative
studies. Disagreements were resolved with a third reviewer
(N.A.L. or L.P.). Studies with a quality score below 25% on
their quality assessment tool were excluded. A low threshold
was used for inclusion in this systematic review because we
aimed to examine the concept of wearable devices more
broadly, without limiting our results to few-to-no high-quality
studies.

Data Extraction
A pretested data extraction framework in Microsoft Excel was
used to extract and chart data from the included studies. One
reviewer (S.S.) extracted data, including study identiﬁers (ti-
tle, ﬁrst author, year of publication, and journal), study design
and setting, country, method of administration (e.g.,
in-
person/face-to-face, and telephone), population characteris-
tics, aims, quantitative outcomes, source of
funding and
reported conﬂicts of interests, ethics approval, study limita-
tions, and any other reported ﬁndings. Demographic and
clinical data including age, sex, ethnicity, types of seizures,
time since diagnosis, symptom severity, number of antiseizure
medication therapies, and other variables were extracted. We
also examined intervention and comparator characteristics for
those studies evaluating a wearable device and collating user
experiences.

Data Synthesis and Analysis
Quantitative synthesis of data included tabulation of results and
extraction of results by outcome instrument. Descriptive syn-
thesis of all ﬁndings by outcome area across all studies (irre-
spective of design or data type) was undertaken. Meta-analysis
of quantitative data was then considered, only if more than 10
experimental comparisons were available for an outcome.

Qualitative analysis of studies was then undertaken, which
allowed extraction of themes from qualitative studies and in-
clusion of free-text comments from mixed-methods studies. A
narrative synthesis strategy was then used to organize, summa-
rize, and present the data based on Guidance on the Conduct of
Narrative Synthesis in Systematic Reviews.8 We used a deductive
approach to thematic analysis with reference to the technology
acceptance model (TAM).9 Main study ﬁndings were tabulated
relative to the TAM to summarize the attitudes toward usage and
intentions to use, as well as the barriers and enablers across
studies and devices. A coding framework was developed by 1
author (N.A.L.) and applied independently by 2 authors (L.P.,
S.V., or N.A.L.). The beliefs of patients, caregivers, and/or cli-
nicians that technology usage will improve the performance10
were coded to perceived usefulness, which was represented by
constructs including productivity, eﬀectiveness, performance,
and overall usefulness of new technology.11 Perceived ease of use
(including easiness to learn, controllability, clarity, ﬂexibility, easy
to become skillful, and overall easiness to use of new technology)

9 was also captured, as was attitude, where we coded data that
reported the user’s evaluation of the desirability of using new
technology.12 The conscious plan to use or not use data or the
device13 was coded to behavioral intention to use, and actual use
was also captured, along with preferred features and functions
identiﬁed through qualitative data.

Word Frequency and Mapping Analysis
To further contribute to the thematic analysis, full texts of the
discussion sections of included studies were analyzed in Python
with Gensim 4.0.0 to identify word frequency and word mapping
for further data-driven exploration of ﬁndings.14 Terms were
given a rank by the summation of their relevance by calculating
the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) sta-
tistic.15 The TF-IDF of a term represents its frequency, adjusted
for how rarely it is used, and assesses the importance of terms
within a collection of documents (in this instance, studies).16
Bigrams (pairs of 2 consecutive terms) were also examined to
supplement the single-term results. In addition, we retrieved key
terms related to clinicians, patients, and caregivers and de-
termined which terms associated the most with the medical
wearable devices by counting occurrences of terms in the sur-
rounding context of any sentences mentioning these.

Data Availability
The full data set and statistical analysis codes will be made
available on reasonable request from any qualiﬁed researcher.

Results

Of the 935 studies that were initially identiﬁed, 47 full-text
articles were independently reviewed. Of these, 23 full-text
studies met our inclusion and exclusion criteria; however, on
rating, 1 study was excluded because it did not meet criteria
following quality appraisal (scoring 0%). We therefore in-
cluded 22 studies in our systematic review. A ﬂowchart
depicting the inclusion of studies is presented in Figure 1.

Study Quality Assessment
followed by
Most studies used a cross-sectional design,
qualitative methodologies; 1 study used a cohort design. Most
studies were of moderate quality, with lower quality rated for
mixed-methods quantitative studies which displayed common
weaknesses in selection of valid and reliable outcome mea-
sures, identiﬁcation and control of confounding factors, and
clear reporting of results. Qualitative studies were of higher
quality, with an average rating of 86% (high). Overall study
quality was rated as acceptable across all appraisal checklists,
with all relevant studies met at least minimal standards of
adequacy in accordance with their respective quality appraisal
tools. The summary of the results of quality appraisals for
cross-sectional, cohort, and qualitative studies is presented in
eTables 1–3 (links.lww.com/WNL/C128).

Study Characteristics
The 22 studies included were published between 2014 and
2021 across at least 14 countries. Collectively, these studies
comprised responses from 3,299 participants including 1,245
patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy, 824 caregivers, and 62
clinicians or healthcare workers. One study included 1,168
responders consisting of patients with epilepsy and caregivers;
however, the proportion of patients with epilepsy or care-
givers who completed the assessments was not reported.

Most studies were observational cross-sectional in design (n =
20), whereas 2 were observational cohort studies. The
method of survey administration included in-person/face-to-
face (n = 10), online (n = 6), hard copy (n = 2), online or hard
copy (n = 1), and telephone (n = 2); the mode of assessment
was not reported in 1 study.

Thirteen studies administered novel survey instruments as part
of their study design, 1 study used previously validated in-
struments in their study design, and another study used both
novel and previously validated instruments. Seven studies
consisted of interviews and/or focus groups, which were ad-
ministered in-person. Variability in outcome instruments and
limited quantitative data reported precluded meta-analysis.

User Preferences and Experiences
Of the 22 studies, 16 examined user preferences, 5 examined
user experiences, and 1 study examined both experiences and
preferences. The characteristics of studies examining prefer-
ences and user experiences are summarized in Tables 1 and 2,
respectively. Of the 6 studies evaluating user experiences, 3
were conducted in an inpatient video-EEG monitoring unit, 2

Descriptive Findings for Studies Examining
User Preferences: Indicators for Assessing the
Acceptance and Satisfaction of Wearables

Acceptance of Wearable Technology
This was assessed in 3 studies. In general, patients with epi-
lepsy expressed a high level of acceptance of wearable tech-
nology for management of their epilepsy.1,17,18 In 1 study,
80% of patients indicated acceptance of use of wearable de-
vices for epilepsy, with the majority (69%) having a preference
toward smartphones and smartwatches.17

Accuracy and False Alarms
Reliability of a wearable device was a core theme among
including desiring a high sensitivity for seizure
studies,

detection and low false alarm rate.18-20 People with epilepsy
valued a higher sensitivity (≥90%)19-21; higher false alarms
(1–2 false detections per week) were more acceptable for pa-
tients with higher seizure frequencies (≥1 seizure per week),
whereas the acceptable false alarm rate was lower (1–2 false
detections per month) in those with lower seizure frequency
(<1 per week).20 In 1 study, higher sensitivity was preferred
over lower false alarm rates.19 Seizure classiﬁcation of multiple
seizure types was desired by healthcare professionals. Real-time
detection was also highly desired by patients and caregivers,
where most participants desired a short detection window of
<15 minutes of seizure occurrence.18,19,21

Cost of Devices and Subscription Fees
Pricing was identiﬁed as a substantial barrier for patients and
caregivers to own a seizure detection device; between 9.6%
and 38% of users had not purchased a seizure detection device
due to cost-related factors.17,22 Potential users were directly

seizure wearables. In a US-based study, concern was expressed
over whether wearables would be covered by health in-
surance; 67% of respondents would not use a seizure de-
tection device unless covered by their provider compared with
only 6.6% who would use it irrespective of coverage.18

Most participants expressed a desire for the wearable device to
cost less than USD$30022,23; in 1 study, however, this was
substantially lower with most participants wanting a preferred
low-cost device of USD$50.21 For a monthly ongoing sub-
scription fee, 43.2% of participants desired this to be <USD$20
per month, 17.8% would pay >USD$21, 38.9% were unwilling
to pay a nominal monthly fee, and 11.6% were willing to spend
>USD$30 if every seizure was reliably identiﬁed.23 Participants
also expressed that they were willing to pay more for an existing
device if it could also aid with seizure detection or prediction.23

Device Design
Patients with epilepsy preferred devices that were non-
stigmatizing and could be incorporated into everyday objects
such as smartwatches or wristbands.1 There was also a desire
expressed by participants to have wearable clothing or jewelry
or for mattress sensors.1 Headbands or hats, cameras, and
acoustic-based detection were the least preferred device op-
tions among patients with epilepsy.1,22 Almost half of patients
with epilepsy would consider wearing small patch sensors on
the chest, shoulder, arm, and neck, but few would tolerate
sensors applied to the head or face areas.1 Implanted devices
were the least preferred1,21; however, devices or sensors
implanted into the body were more acceptable to participants
with epilepsy than those implanted directly into the brain.1
Conversely, caregivers favored more intrusive methods of
monitoring, such as cameras and microphones, particularly to
address their fear of nocturnal seizures.22

Features that patients with epilepsy desired the most included
monitoring of sleep quality,17 mood,17 concentration,17 at-
tention and memory,17 heart rate,17,20 respiratory rate,17,20
pulse oximetry, body movements,17,20 and muscle activity20;
speciﬁcations most valued included long battery life (≥24
hours)23 and water resistance.23 Audio/video alerts were also
preferred with an unlimited signal range.20 Device comfort
was consistently ranked as important by both caregivers and
patients with epilepsy.22,23

Optimizing Care
Improved care was a core theme for patients with epilepsy and
caregivers, where most participants felt that wearables would
help optimize care.20,22 Automated and “real-time” alerts were
supported by most patients with epilepsy (85%) and care-
givers (95%).22,23 Caregivers expressed that epilepsy patients
with frequent habitual seizures would result in greater im-
provements to quality of care, compared to those with fewer
seizures.22 In 1 study, clinicians expressed an interest in using
smart technology to educate caregivers and adolescents with
epilepsy regarding their care including information about

medications, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)
risk, and women-speciﬁc information regarding epilepsy and
reproductive health issues.24

Privacy
Patients with epilepsy often expressed concerns that wearables
intruded on their privacy. In 1 study, 59.6% were concerned
about privacy and conﬁdentiality.17 Speciﬁc concerns included
reduced privacy, lack of control over the information, and
potential negative eﬀects on their work or their ability to
drive.17 In comparison, caregivers were less concerned about
privacy and conﬁdentiality, where only 30.8% expressed con-
cerns about data not being conﬁdential, lack of control over the
information, and potential negative eﬀects on their work.17

SUDEP Safety Monitoring
Monitoring of at-risk patients of SUDEP was infrequently
discussed with patients with epilepsy, caregivers, and health-
care professionals. In 1 study, heart rate was identiﬁed as the
most important measurement for both seizure detection and
SUDEP interventions.20

Technologic Competency
The technologic readiness of participants was a core theme
across multiple studies.17,20,23,25 Most participants had no
previous experience with wearable devices for seizure tracking
(78.2%–97.3%).20,25 However, most participants expressed
familiarity with existing technologic devices such as personal
computing, tablets, smartphones, Wi-Fi, and smartwatches.17,23

Descriptive Findings for Studies Examining
User Experiences: Indicators for Device
Tolerance and Use

Autonomy
Autonomy was a core theme for both patients with epilepsy
and caregivers. In a residential study of caregivers of patients
who used the seizure detection bracelet, most carers reported
increased freedom, but only a minority thought that the pa-
tients had more autonomy as a result of device use.26 In 1
study, child autonomy was improved.27

Comfort
Wearable devices that were already commercially available were
found to be comfortable with no substantial side eﬀects.28,29

Device Design
In 1 prospective study that evaluated multiple commercially
available devices including 2 wristwatches (Empatica E4 and
Activinsights GENEActiv), an armband (Biovotion Everion),
and patch sensors (Byteﬂies Sensor Dots and Epitel Epilog), all
devices were positively received.29 Most participants (75%)
demonstrated a strong preference for the wristwatch design,
with the Empatica E4 being the most preferred device.29

Optimizing Care
Most patients with epilepsy and caregivers felt that the
wearables helped provide optimal and more timely care.26

Downloaded from https://www.neurology.org by Universitaet zu Koeln on 21 November 2025However, only a minority of patients with epilepsy and
caregivers reported that wearables reduced the burden of
caregiving.26

Mental Health and Quality of Life
Most patients with epilepsy and caregivers who used wearable
devices had a reduction in anxiety compared with nonusers.25
Conversely, quality of life was only associated with minor to
nonsigniﬁcant improvements with device use.25,27

Usability and Interface
Usability and having an interface that is easy to use was an
important theme for patients, caregivers, and clinicians in 3
studies. In 2 studies that examined wearables currently avail-
able in the market for seizure detection, most participants
reported that the devices were easy to use.28,29 However, in
another study involving 30 patients with epilepsy, which
assessed the Empatica smartwatch, only 50% of the partici-
pants were able to perform all tasks in relation to setting up
and operating the device following a brief tutorial without
further assistance; 36.7% required additional assistance, and
13.3% needed constant supervision for at least 1 task.30

Thematic Coding: Technology Acceptance
The elements of technology acceptance deemed by respon-
dents to be important within the qualitative studies are cate-
gorized according to the TAM in Table 3, highlighting that
the attitudes toward use and perceived usefulness were
reported more consistently across qualitative studies than
actual use or ease of use. These ﬁndings, which are consistent
with the TAM, suggest that perceived ease of use inﬂuences
perceived usefulness and ultimately attitude toward use of
devices. The actual use was also highlighted across studies,
with mixed-methods designs, where participants provided
qualitative information after a period of use being able to
provide key insights into both their experience and their
preference.

After excluding terms related to study method, TF-IDF
identiﬁed key terms of “speciﬁcity,” “cost,” and “battery” in
the discussion sections of included studies. These single-term
results are further strengthened by the bigram results, where
the key bigrams of “battery life,” “insurance coverage” (ﬁ-
nance), “prediction/detection quality” (false alarms and sig-
nal quality), and the eﬀect of devices on “daily life” were of
greatest importance. Figure 2, A and B presents these term
frequency-inverse document frequency graphs.

Discussion

Wearable devices for automated seizure detection show great
potential in improving management of epilepsy. Although this
is an emerging ﬁeld, we identiﬁed 22 studies in this systematic
review, assessing the preferences or experiences of patients
with epilepsy in relation to wearable devices for seizure
monitoring and detection with varying study methodologies.
We identiﬁed several themes that were important to people

with epilepsy including optimizing care, accuracy, autonomy,
privacy, nonstigmatizing, easy to use, and design. We found
that user acceptance of wearable technology was strongly
inﬂuenced by accuracy, design, and comfort.

We found that a central theme among user preferences of
people with epilepsy and caregivers was accuracy, which was
discussed as including high sensitivity, low false alarm rates,
and “real-time” detection with a short latency period between
seizure occurrence and providing alerts. There was a greater
emphasis placed on sensitivity, which may reﬂect preventative
strategies for risk reduction and underlies many other im-
portant themes and desires identiﬁed such as optimizing care.
The sensitivity requirements and false alarm rates required by
participants are currently matched by the few wearable de-
vices both in trial stages and available in the market, but these
wearable devices were only recommended for detecting tonic-
clonic seizures.31 Most desired health features for optimizing
care such as seizure prediction, but these features are currently
not available for any approved wearable device for automated
seizure detection.

People with epilepsy preferred a nonstigmatizing design that
could readily be integrated into daily life (e.g., mobile phones
or smartwatches). This raises complex psychosocial issues
that need to be explored in well-designed studies with ap-
propriate screening instruments to assess the eﬀect of wear-
ables on such factors.

Despite being a signiﬁcant driver of the need for wearables in
epilepsy, SUDEP was rarely discussed with patients and
caregivers. SUDEP is common after a nocturnal tonic-clonic
seizure,32 and in most cases, deaths are unwitnessed.33
Timely interventions may potentially result
in risk re-
duction.34 In 1 study, nocturnal monitoring using a smart-
watch with safety monitoring and a closed-loop feedback
system found reduced anxiety in young persons and their
caregivers, particularly during sleep.27 Furthermore, this
study found that use of a smartwatch for monitoring was
preferred to continuous monitoring with video and/or a
microphone to alert caregivers or having someone sleep in
the same room because this aﬀects privacy and reduces au-
tonomy.27 Because most SUDEPs occur
in otherwise
healthy young individuals with epilepsy,35 the preferences
and user experiences of those at high risk and their caregivers
need to be better understood.

Lived experiences are integral to the development of wear-
ables. Most recently, the Wearables for Epilepsy and Research
International Study Group proposed recommendations for
reporting results from prospective wearable studies aimed at
seizure detection.36 These included obtaining usability chal-
lenges and user perspectives from people with epilepsy who
wear the device(s). Few studies identiﬁed as part of our sys-
tematic review examined the preferences and experiences of
users. It is disappointing that although the information cap-
tured in these studies was informative, there is lack of evidence

user acceptance and tolerance.

User experiences of patients with epilepsy and their caregivers
were consistent with preferences identiﬁed regarding design,
where wristwatches were identiﬁed as the most preferred
design for seizure tracking. In clinical trials of wearable de-
vices, wristwatches, armbands, and sensors were all tolerated
well, although there was a greater preference for wristwatches.
However, other critical aspects of device acceptance, such as
optimizing care or privacy, which were identiﬁed as core
themes for patients with epilepsy, were not assessed in studies
examining user experiences. This may largely be due to most
trials being conducted in a video-EEG monitoring unit, where
such themes are diﬃcult to assess. In speciﬁc devices, the
Empatica E4, which is currently the only Food and Drug
Administration–approved wristwatch for seizure detection,
matched the user preferences of patients with epilepsy in
several core areas including device design, cost (including
subscription fees), high sensitivity, and providing real-time
alerts. However, because it is only approved for the detection
of convulsive seizures, it does not meet the desire of health-
care providers in being able to detect multiple seizure types.

The studies with the largest sample sizes used structured or
semistructured online surveys to capture perspectives of
participants. Although surveys are eﬃcient, they limit re-
sponses to predeﬁned questions, aﬀecting the richness of the
data collected. Despite having smaller samples, studies that
used interviews or focus groups identiﬁed a broader and likely
more complete range of needs and experiences regarding
seizure wearables. Indeed, several later studies used results
from these focus groups to construct more comprehensive
surveys.

The strengths of this systematic review are that most included
studies were of moderate quality or higher. However, there
are several limitations identiﬁed as part of this study. There
are currently no validated tools that comprehensively examine
wearable needs and desires in this population. As a result,
reported study methodologies were highly heterogenous,
precluding meaningful meta-analysis of the ﬁndings. This
challenge could be partially overcome with the development
of standardized and validated tools to measure patient expe-
riences of wearable devices using the themes identiﬁed in this
study. Studies examining the user experiences of patients with
epilepsy were mostly conducted in video-EEG inpatient set-
tings for typically a week, which limit our understanding of the
real-world utility of wearables on important themes such as
optimizing care, reducing caregiver burden, privacy, technol-
ogy competency, and autonomy. Most included studies were
small and included speciﬁc and niche populations (e.g.,
transition youth) or were biased toward younger adults with
epilepsy. Therefore, their ﬁndings may not be generalizable to
broader epilepsy populations. There are limited data on re-
quirements for children or older adults with epilepsy, who
may have diﬀerent needs and preferences.37 Although studies

were conducted in >14 countries, they comprised mostly in-
dividuals from high-income settings and few included patients
from low socioeconomic backgrounds who may have diﬀerent
preferences (e.g., cost and design). Several studies did not
report whether people with epilepsy or their caregivers
completed survey instruments, which introduces further bias.
Finally, the word mapping analysis identiﬁed terms that were
deemed important to authors of qualitative articles, but the
terms may not have been directly quoted by the participants in
the studies.

In conclusion, this systematic review has demonstrated an
emerging body of research examining the acceptance and
preferences of consumers (people with epilepsy, caregivers, and
healthcare professionals) in relation to wearable devices for
seizure detection. Although few studies have explored both
acceptance and preference alongside use, ﬁndings suggest that
device features (including accuracy, battery life, and wearability
to permit integration into everyday life) along with cost and
ease of use were key themes identiﬁed by the authors of the
included studies. We expect further advances in disruptive
wearable technology, which may contribute toward over-
coming these technical challenges.38 We recommend the de-
velopment of standardized instruments to routinely measure
participant acceptance in future studies and cost-beneﬁt anal-
yses to provide key data for future policy decision making. This
will help determine the most eﬀective methods to monitor
seizures and improve the lives of people with epilepsy.
