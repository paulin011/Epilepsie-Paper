BSTRACT
Background

More than 30 percent of patients with
epilepsy have inadequate control of seizures with drug
therapy, but why this happens and whether it can be
predicted are unknown. We studied the response to
antiepileptic drugs in patients with newly diagnosed
epilepsy  to  identify  factors  associated  with  subse-
quent poor control of seizures.

Methods

We  prospectively  studied  525  patients
(age, 9 to 93 years) who were given a diagnosis, treat-
ed, and followed up at a single center between 1984
and 1997. Epilepsy was classified as idiopathic (with
a  presumed  genetic  basis),  symptomatic  (resulting
from  a  structural  abnormality),  or  cryptogenic  (re-
sulting from an unknown underlying cause). Patients
were  considered  to  be  seizure-free  if  they  had  not
had any seizures for at least one year.

Results
Among the 525 patients, 333 (63 percent)
remained seizure-free during antiepileptic-drug treat-
ment or after treatment was stopped. The prevalence
of  persistent  seizures  was  higher  in  patients  with
symptomatic  or  cryptogenic  epilepsy  than  in  those
with  idiopathic  epilepsy  (40  percent  vs.  26  percent,
P=0.004) and in patients who had had more than 20
seizures before starting treatment than in those who
had had fewer (51 percent vs. 29 percent, P<0.001).
The  seizure-free  rate  was  similar  in  patients  who
were treated with a single established drug (67 per-
cent)  and  patients  who  were  treated  with  a  single
new  drug  (69  percent).  Among  470  previously  un-
treated patients, 222 (47 percent) became seizure-free
during treatment with their first antiepileptic drug and
67 (14 percent) became seizure-free during treatment
with a second or third drug. In 12 patients (3 percent)
epilepsy was controlled by treatment with two drugs.
Among  patients  who  had  no  response  to  the  first
drug, the percentage who subsequently became sei-
zure-free  was  smaller  (11  percent)  when  treatment
failure was due to lack of efficacy than when it was
due to intolerable side effects (41 percent) or an id-
iosyncratic reaction (55 percent).
Conclusions
Patients who have many seizures be-
fore therapy or who have an inadequate response to
initial treatment with antiepileptic drugs are likely to
have  refractory  epilepsy.  (N  Engl  J  Med  2000;342:

study of patients who were given a diagnosis of epi-

which  we  evaluated  their  response  to  antiepileptic-
drug therapy and attempted to determine the factors
associated with a poor response to therapy.

METHODS

Patients

The study included 525 consecutive unselected children, ado-
lescents, and adults in whom epilepsy was diagnosed and antiep-
ileptic-drug  therapy  begun  at  the  Epilepsy  Unit  of  the  Western
Infirmary  in  Glasgow,  Scotland,  between  January  1,  1984,  and
December  31,  1997.  Most  of  the  patients  were  referred  to  the
unit by primary care physicians, but a minority (8 percent) were
referred from the hospital’s accident and emergency department.
10
During the first visit, we used a structured questionnaire to collect
demographic and clinical information from the patients and any
witnesses to the seizures and performed a general physical and neu-
rologic examination.
 Additional studies were carried out as clini-
cally indicated. A neurophysiologist performed surface electroen-
cephalography,  either  using  a  standard  approach  or  testing  the
patients after sleep deprivation, to look for interictal changes that
might aid in the diagnosis, help to identify the seizure focus, and
facilitate the classification of the epilepsy. Neuroimaging, partic-
ularly computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, was
performed by a neuroradiologist to screen for underlying structural
abnormalities that might have caused the epilepsy. Information ob-
tained  from  the  history,  physical  examination,  and  other  studies
was used to classify the patient’s epilepsy, since the type of epilepsy
has implications for prognosis and the approach to treatment.

11

Approach to Treatment

For all patients who were given a diagnosis of epilepsy, the ap-
propriate  antiepileptic  drug  was  chosen  after  discussion  among
the clinicians, taking into account the type of seizures and other
characteristics  and  the  efficacy,  side  effects,  and  interaction  pro-
files of the available drugs.
 Some patients volunteered to partic-
ipate in randomized studies, in which case the antiepileptic drug
administered  remained  unknown  to  both  the  clinicians  and  the
patients during the study period. Protocols for all drug trials were

formed consent.

Patients were subsequently evaluated at the epilepsy clinic every
four to six weeks for the first six months and at least every four
months  thereafter.  If  medical  attention  was  necessary  between
scheduled appointments, the patients or their primary care phy-
sicians could call the epilepsy unit by using a dedicated telephone
line. At each follow-up visit, clinical information and the response
to antiepileptic-drug therapy were recorded. Compliance was mon-
itored at the clinic,

Drug doses were adjusted as clinical circumstances dictated, with
particular attention paid to efficacy and tolerability. Patients were
treated with a single drug when possible, as is recommended prac-
tice.
 Treatment was changed to another drug if seizures remained
5
uncontrolled or if the patient had an idiosyncratic reaction or in-
tolerable side effects. A combination of drugs was used in patients
whose epilepsy remained uncontrolled despite treatment with two
or three single drugs. Patients whose epilepsy was the result of a
possibly remediable lesion, such as mesial temporal sclerosis, a tu-
mor, or arteriovenous malformation, were referred for surgery.

Definitions

5,16-19

The  types  of  seizures  and  epileptic  syndromes  were  classified
according  to  the  guidelines  of  the  International  League  against
Epilepsy.
  Seizures  were  classified  as  generalized  convulsive
(e.g., tonic, clonic, or tonic–clonic) or nonconvulsive (e.g., absence
or myoclonic) or as partial (focal), depending on the clinical pres-
entation and the results of the studies described above. The epi-
lepsy was classified as idiopathic, symptomatic, or cryptogenic, ac-
cording to the putative cause and depending on such factors as the
age of the patient, the type of seizure, the presence or absence of
a family history of epilepsy, and the presence or absence of an un-
derlying neurologic lesion. Patients with a particular type of epi-
lepsy may have more than one type of seizure. Idiopathic epilepsy,
such as childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilep-
sy, is presumed to have a genetic origin. Symptomatic epilepsy is
considered  to  be  the  consequence  of  a  known  structural  abnor-
mality, such as mesial temporal sclerosis, cortical dysplasia, arterio-
venous malformation, stroke, or cerebral palsy. Cryptogenic epi-
lepsy is presumed to be due to an underlying but unidentified focal
abnormality on the basis of clinical information and study results.
Patients were considered to be free of seizures if they had not
had seizures of any type for a minimum of one year while receiv-
ing  the  same  dose  of  antiepileptic  drug  or  while  not  taking  any
medication. Patients who had seizures were, by definition, consid-
ered to have refractory epilepsy. The extent of control of seizures
was assessed at the time of the patient’s last clinic visit.

Statistical Analysis

Patients were divided into two groups for purposes of compar-
ison  according  to  whether  or  not  they  were  seizure-free  during
follow-up. We used the chi-square test for comparisons of categor-
ical  data  and  the  Mann–Whitney  test  for  comparisons  of  non-
parametric continuous data. We used the chi-square test for trend
to assess the effect of the number of seizures before treatment on
the outcome. Potential interaction between factors was examined
by logistic-regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-tailed.
Statistical  calculations  were  performed  with  use  of  Minitab  for
Windows software (version 11.21).

Characteristics of the Patients

RESULTS

Overall,  629  of  the  3209  patients  who  were  re-
ferred to the clinic between January 1, 1984, and De-
cember 31, 1997, were not being treated at the time

of referral. They included patients who had not pre-
viously been given a diagnosis of epilepsy and those in
whom  antiepileptic-drug  treatment  had  been  with-
drawn.  Eight  patients  died  from  a  variety  of  causes
during  treatment,  74  did  not  return  for  follow-up
after treatment with the first antiepileptic drug was
started, and 22 were excluded because of uncertainty
about the diagnosis or persistent noncompliance with
treatment. The remaining 525 patients (52 percent
of  whom  were  male)  constituted  the  study  group.
Among  them,  470  patients  had  never  received  anti-
epileptic-drug therapy (Fig. 1). The median duration
of  follow-up  was  5  years  (range,  2  to 16),  and  90
percent of the patients attended the clinic for at least
3 years. The median age at referral was 29 years (range,
9 to 93), and the median age at the onset of epilepsy
was 26 years (range, <1 to 92) (Table 1). There was
no significant difference in sex, age at referral or the
onset  of  seizures,  prevalence  of  a  family  history  of
epilepsy, or prevalence of a history of febrile convul-
sions  between  the  group  that  became  seizure-free
and the group with uncontrolled epilepsy (Table 1).

Effects of Treatment

At the time of the last clinic visit, 333 patients (63
percent)  were  seizure-free  (Fig.  1).  Among  the  55
patients  who  had  previously  received  one  or  more
antiepileptic drugs, 56 percent became seizure-free,
as  compared  with  64  percent  of  the  patients  who
had  not  been  previously  treated.  Among  the  previ-
ously treated patients, the prognosis was better in the
38 patients whose previous antiepileptic-drug thera-
py had been withdrawn after a seizure-free period of
at least two years (66 percent were seizure-free at the
end  of  the  study)  than  in  the 17  patients  in  whom
therapy was discontinued for other reasons (35 per-
cent were seizure-free at the end of the study), such
as lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects. The 55
patients  who  had  previously  received  antiepileptic
drugs were included in the analysis of other factors
associated  with  refractory  epilepsy,  with  the  excep-
tion of the analysis of the response to the first anti-
epileptic drug.

Classification of Epilepsy

One  hundred  forty  patients  (27  percent)  were
classified as having idiopathic epilepsy, 150 (29 per-
cent)  as  having  symptomatic  epilepsy,  and  235  (45
percent) as having cryptogenic epilepsy. A higher pro-
portion of patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic
epilepsy continued to have seizures during treatment
than of patients with idiopathic epilepsy (40 percent
vs.  26  percent,  P=0.004;  relative  risk, 1.5;  95  per-
cent  confidence  interval, 1.1  to  2.1).  There  was  no
significant difference between the proportion of pa-
tients with symptomatic epilepsy and the proportion
with  cryptogenic  epilepsy  who  continued  to  have
seizures (43 percent vs. 39 percent). There was a sig-

with uncontrolled epilepsy in relation to the number
of seizures before treatment (P<0.001) (Fig. 2), even
after the exclusion of patients who had only one sei-
zure before treatment (P<0.001). Epilepsy was un-
controlled in 94 of the 185 patients (51 percent) who
reported  having  more  than  20  seizures  before  the
initiation of therapy, as compared with 98 of the 340
patients  (29  percent)  who  had  20  seizures  or  fewer
(P<0.001; relative risk, 1.8; 95 percent confidence in-
terval,  1.4  to  2.2).  Logistic-regression  analysis  re-
vealed no significant interaction between the type of
epilepsy and the number of seizures before treatment.

Antiepileptic-Drug Therapy

Four hundred twenty-three patients (81 percent)
were being treated with a single antiepileptic drug at
the last clinic visit; 289 were receiving an established
drug (155 were receiving carbamazepine, 125 valpro-
ate sodium, 8 phenytoin, and 1 ethosuximide), and
134 were taking one of the newer antiepileptic drugs
(99 were receiving lamotrigine, 15 gabapentin, 7 ox-
carbazepine,  9  tiagabine,  3  topiramate,  and 1  viga-
batrin).  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  sei-
zure-free rates between the groups (67 percent vs. 69
percent). Overall, 70 patients tried combination ther-
apy. Fifty-three were being treated with two antiep-
ileptic drugs at the time of the last clinic visit, of whom
only 12 (23 percent) were seizure-free (Fig. 1). None
of the five patients who were receiving three antiepi-
leptic drugs at the time of the last clinic visit were sei-
zure-free. Forty-four patients had chosen not to con-
tinue treatment with antiepileptic drugs, some after a
period of remission (39 percent), some because of side

effects (48 percent), and the remainder for personal
reasons (13 percent). Thirty-four of these patients (77
percent) had been seizure-free for more than a year.
One hundred ninety-five patients were enrolled in
double-blind studies comparing an established anti-
epileptic drug with a new drug. Of the 104 patients
(53 percent) who completed such a study (38 received
carbamazepine, 13 valproate sodium, 30 lamotrigine,
5 gabapentin, 5 oxcarbazepine, 12 tiagabine, and 1 fel-
bamate), there was no significant difference in the sei-
zure-free rate between the patients who received an
established drug and those who received a new drug
(71 percent vs. 66 percent). All but four of the pa-
tients  continued  to  be  seizure-free  while  receiving
the  same  drug  after  the  study  ended.  The  majority
of the 91 patients who did not complete those stud-
ies (59 percent) withdrew because of side effects. The
interpretation  of  data  on  outcomes  was  limited  by
the  fact  that  the  assigned  drug  remained  unknown
in  the  case  of  some  of  these  patients.  However,  62
percent of the patients (120 of 195) who participat-
ed in studies of single drugs became seizure-free, a
value that was similar to that for the rest of the co-
hort, suggesting that there was no bias in the selec-
tion of patients for these studies.

Efficacy of First Drug

Among the 470 patients who had never before re-
ceived an antiepileptic drug, 301 (64 percent) became
seizure-free  during  treatment.  In  222  patients  (47
percent), epilepsy was controlled by the first antiep-

ileptic drug, which was an established drug in the case
of 151  patients  and  a  new  drug  in  the  case  of  71
patients  (Fig.  3  and  Table  2).  Fifteen  of  these  222
patients  remained  seizure-free  after  the  discontinua-
tion of the drug. The seizure-free rates were the same
whether a new or an established drug was given. Sixty-
seven of the 470 patients (14 percent) became seizure-
free during treatment with a second or third drug. In
12 patients (3 percent of the total population) epilepsy
was controlled by treatment with two drugs (Table 2). 
One hundred thirteen patients discontinued their
first drug because of lack of efficacy; 69 because of
intolerable  side  effects;  29  because  of  idiosyncratic
reactions, such as rash and hepatotoxicity; and 37 for
other reasons, including concern about potential ad-
verse effects, planning a pregnancy, and a change of
mind about drug treatment (Fig. 3). Only 79 of these
248 patients (32 percent) subsequently became sei-
zure-free.  The  outcome  among  these  patients  was
strongly associated with the reason for the failure of
treatment with the first drug (P<0.001) (Fig. 3). Six-
teen of the patients with an idiosyncratic reaction (55
percent) subsequently became seizure-free, as did 28
of the patients with intolerable side effects (41 per-
cent), but only 12 of the patients in whom treatment
with the first drug was ineffective (11 percent) sub-
sequently became seizure-free.

DISCUSSION

In our study, the overall rate of remission of sei-
zures of 63 percent was similar to that in several hos-

patients in our study who had a known or probable
structural cerebral abnormality were 1.5 times as like-
ly to have refractory disease as those with idiopathic
epilepsy. A large number of seizures before treatment
was a poor prognostic indicator, an observation that
has also been made previously.
 It is tempting to

Our  finding  that  many  patients  were  seizure-free

the observations that 47 percent of the patients who
had not previously received an antiepileptic drug be-
came seizure-free during treatment with the first drug
and that 77 percent of those who stopped treatment
remained seizure-free.

The rates of remission were similar in patients who
received an established antiepileptic drug and those
who were treated with a new antiepileptic drug. In
randomized, double-blind trials comparing carbamaz-
epine with lamotrigine, there was no difference in ef-
ficacy  between  the  two  drugs,  although  fewer  side
effects and lower dropout rates were reported among
patients who were treated with lamotrigine.

tients subsequently became seizure-free, as compared
with 41 percent of the patients who had intolerable
side effects and 55 percent of those with an idiosyn-
cratic reaction. Among the patients who had no re-
sponse to the first antiepileptic drug, 14 percent be-
came  seizure-free  when  treatment  was  changed  to
another drug, but only 3 percent became seizure-free
while taking two drugs.

Our observations may be useful in devising more
effective therapy for patients with refractory epilep-
sy. They reinforce the assertion that for patients with
correctable structural abnormalities, surgery should be
considered  as  soon  as  treatment  with  two  first-line

proach can render up to 80 percent of patients sei-
zure-free. For the majority of patients, in whom ep-
ilepsy cannot be cured by surgery, antiepileptic drugs
remain the mainstay of treatment. Our finding that
only 3 percent of patients became seizure-free while
taking  more  than  one  drug  highlights  the  need  to
combine drugs in a more rational fashion by taking
into consideration their mechanisms of action.

Our findings offer support for the hypothesis that
some patients have refractory epilepsy at the outset.
Refractory epilepsy may be present from the begin-
ning rather than evolve over time, since the clinical
characteristics of this type are apparent early in the
course of disease. Such patients are more likely to have
underlying structural cerebral abnormalities, to have
had more than 20 seizures before treatment is initi-
ated, and to have an inadequate response to the first
antiepileptic  drug  prescribed.  Perhaps  the  drug  has
limited  access  to  the  epileptic  focus  but  not  to  the
rest of the brain, as a result of the differential expres-
sion of drug transporters at the blood–brain barri-
er,
 and thus cannot fully exert the desired phar-
macologic effect without neurotoxicity.

40,41

In conclusion, our findings indicate that some pa-
tients with refractory epilepsy can be identified early
in the course of disease and can thus be targeted for
rational combination therapy or surgery.
