# Langan et al. - 2005 - Case-control study of SUDEP

Case-control study of SUDEP

Y. Langan, MB; L. Nashef, MD; and J.W. Sander, PhD

Abstract—Objective: To examine the influence of various factors on the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
(SUDEP). Methods: The authors investigated 154 cases in which a postmortem examination was performed. Each case had
four controls with epilepsy from the community, matched for age and geographic location. Backward stepwise conditional
logistic regression analysis was performed and odds ratios for risk and protection were determined. Results: The risk of
SUDEP was increased with a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the previous 3 months (odds ratio [OR]: 13.8,
95% CI: 6.6 to 29.1). The presence of supervision at night was found to be protective (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.8) when a
supervising individual shared the same bedroom or when special precautions such as a listening device were employed
(OR: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.0 to 0.3). Conclusion: This work lends support to the view that SUDEP is a seizure-related phenome-
non and that control of tonic-clonic seizures is important in its prevention. Nocturnal supervision seems to protect against
SUDEP.

Cohort studies have reported risk factors for SUDEP
including youth, male sex, remote symptomatic epi-
lepsy, structural findings on neuropathology, severe
epilepsy, alcohol abuse, abnormal EEGs with epilep-
tiform changes, mental handicap, use of psychotropic
medication, nonadherence to treatment, abrupt med-
ication changes, low antiepileptic drug (AED) levels,
and unwitnessed nocturnal seizures.1

Case-control studies have identified a number of
risk factors for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
(SUDEP).2-5 A study from Stockholm3 found that a
higher risk of SUDEP was observed in those with
more frequent seizures, polytherapy, frequent medi-
cation changes, longer disease duration, and idio-
pathic epilepsy. Another study from the United
States4 reported increased risk of SUDEP by tonic-
clonic seizures, polytherapy, and the presence of a
learning disability. Another US study of mortality in
AED development programs found that disease se-
verity was significantly related to the risk of
SUDEP.5 Limitations of these studies include small
numbers,4 low postmortem rates,4 and the exclusion
of patients off AED therapy.3 Some risk factors iden-
tified by cohort studies were not found to be signifi-
cant in case-control studies.

We undertook a large case-control study to con-
firm previous results and to look at factors not previ-
ously examined.

Methods. People with epilepsy who died suddenly between the
ages of 16 and 50 years were identified by coroners and neurolo-
gists and by interviews with bereaved families. Deaths occurred
between 1989 and 1998.

Coroners in England and Wales were invited to notify neurolo-
gists of cases considered to be SUDEP. Neurologists were con-
tacted via the British Neurologic Surveillance Unit,6 an
organization that coordinates and improves the ascertainment of
rare neurologic disorders in the United Kingdom. Cases were also

identified through interviews with self-referred parents and part-
ners of the deceased through Epilepsy Bereaved?, a UK support
charity.

Interviews involved a semistructured questionnaire that exam-
ined aspects of the patients’ epilepsy, medical and social back-
ground, and the circumstances of death. Written informed consent
was obtained before the interview.

Subjects were individuals with a history of active epilepsy (at
least one seizure in the past 5 years or taking an AED if in
remission) whose death fulfilled the following definition: sudden,
unexpected, witnessed, or unwitnessed, nontraumatic, and non-
drowning death in an individual with epilepsy, with or without
evidence of a seizure and excluding documented status epilepticus
in which the postmortem examination does not reveal a cause for
death.7

Background information was obtained from general practitio-
ners, hospital consultants and, where appropriate, coroners.
Where necessary, information was traced through the Office for
National Statistics.

Each case had four controls matched for age ((cid:1)5 years) and
geographic location. Practices in the appropriate geographic areas
were identified from the MRC General Practice Research Frame-
work, a network of approximately 900 groups of family practitio-
ners (general practitioners) throughout the United Kingdom and
includes practices in urban and rural areas. The groups allow
access to 11% of the UK population.

Individuals with epilepsy suitable to act as controls were iden-
tified using a diagnostic index or prescription database. Controls
were randomly chosen from this eligible population, and, once a
diagnosis of epilepsy was confirmed, data were extracted from the
patients’ medical records. The factors under examination included
duration of epilepsy, seizure type and control including changes in
seizure severity, treatment history and compliance, recent AED
withdrawal, concomitant use of psychotropic medication, family
history of sudden death, learning disability, EEG changes, history
of drug or alcohol abuse, presence of other medical conditions,
level of attendance at doctor or hospital appointments, and super-
vision at night. Supervision at night was defined as the presence
in the bedroom of an individual of normal intelligence and at least
10 years old or the use of special precautions. Special precautions
involved regular checks throughout the night or the use of a lis-
tening device.

For both cases and controls, 10% of entries were randomly
chosen and the accuracy of data retrieval from notes and data
entry into the database checked. The error rate was less than 5%.

was performed and odds ratios with the CI were determined. An
unknown category was inserted for each of the above variables to
optimize data use. Variables with information missing in more
than 35% of cases were excluded from the analysis. The excluded
variables were the presence of hippocampal sclerosis, corrected QT
interval, and AED and alcohol levels. The analysis controlled for
frequency of convulsive seizures so that the effect of other vari-
ables could be assessed independently of their relationship to sei-
zure frequency. For each variable found to be significant, the
model was retested after removing cases with information missing
for that variable. Only variables that remained significant in this
situation were included in the final model.

The study was ethically approved centrally and also by the
individual local research ethics committee for each general prac-
tice involved in the ascertainment of controls.

Results. One hundred fifty-four cases (97 men, 57
women) were identified, 27 through Epilepsy Bereaved?
Mean age was 32 years. Most were found dead in bed, and
there was evidence to support a recent seizure in most
(table 1).

Twenty-three deaths were witnessed (15%), the major-
ity occurring in association with a convulsive seizure. As
previously reported, there was often breathing difficulty
before death.9

The variables included in the model and their odds ra-
tios are illustrated in table 2. There were eight individuals
in the “don’t know” category for carbamazepine, which re-
sulted in a failure of the model to converge; therefore,
these individuals were omitted from the analysis. A his-
tory of generalized seizures and a high frequency of them
in the recent past was associated with a significant in-
creased risk of SUDEP. Use of more than three AEDs also
appears to increase the risk, as does the use of carbamaz-
epine. Supervision at night and a history of asthma appear
to be protective.

Discussion. This case-control study is large, with
postmortem examinations having been performed for
all cases. We accept that using different sources of
information for cases and controls may have intro-
duced bias, but we have made efforts to minimize
this by having a case:control ratio of 1:4 and making
allowances for unknown information in the analysis.
In the United Kingdom, 90% of such deaths will
be referred to the coroner and undergo postmortem
examination. The recent National Clinical Sentinel
Audit of Epilepsy-Related Death suggests, however,
that postmortem examinations may be inadequate
and that investigations such as toxicology are often
underused.10

There was an excess of males among the 154 cases
identified; however, gender was not found to be an
independent risk factor for SUDEP. Other au-

thors11,12 have also reported an excess of males in
series of SUDEP cases, but this has not been a uni-
versal finding.4,13

The fact that SUDEP risk is increased by convul-
sive seizures is in keeping with the findings of previ-
ous research.2-5,9,12,14 Death has also been linked to

seizures

Greater frequency of generalized tonic-clonic sei-
zures also adversely influenced the risk of SUDEP in
our study, and this finding has been reported by
others.3-5 This relationship did not hold for those
with more than 50 convulsive seizures in 3 months,
but numbers were small. The control of such seizures
may be important in SUDEP prevention. The risk of

made about changes to AED therapy.

To date, no AED has been clearly associated with
an altered risk of SUDEP.3,17 Some authors have sug-
gested that carbamazepine may adversely affect
such a risk,18 particularly at high doses.19 Our find-
ings also suggest an association with current use of
this AED; the arrhythmogenic potential of carbamaz-
epine is recognized, as is its influence on heart rate
variability.20-23 Nevertheless, there may be confound-
ing factors that have not been examined and causal-
ity should not be assumed.

We did not find current polytherapy, which may
reflect both seizure frequency and severity, to be an
independent risk factor. Other authors3,4,24 have com-
mented on polytherapy as a risk factor for SUDEP.

We found that the greater the number of AEDs
ever taken, the higher the risk was of SUDEP. A
case-control study from Sweden3 found that frequent
drug changes increase the risk of SUDEP. In this
study, risk was also increased in those who have
never been on AEDs or whose treatment history is
unclear, which may reflect the risk associated with
the lack of treatment and uncontrolled seizures.

In some studies, poor adherence with the medica-
tion has been associated with an increased risk of
SUDEP,4,25 but there is also evidence to the con-
trary.17 In this study, adherence was not found to be
a significant independent risk factor for SUDEP, al-
though this was not assessed objectively.

Asthma appears to be protective, although it
should be noted that the data reflect a diagnosis of
asthma noted in the medical record but not verified.
Such individuals may be protected through increased
supervision or medical input. Alternatively, because
of our rigid definition of SUDEP, cases with other
medical conditions including respiratory disease may
have been excluded, increasing the relative incidence
of asthma among controls. Antiasthma medications
may antagonize mechanisms responsible for SUDEP
or the asthma itself may prevent pulmonary compli-
cations of seizures. Nonepileptic attacks, which may
have a high event frequency, may be overrepre-
sented in the control group and indeed there has
been a report suggesting that asthma is a risk factor
for nonepileptic events.26

We have previously suggested that because most
deaths are unwitnessed, supervision and attention to
recovery after a seizure may be important in SUDEP
prevention,9 and our findings here support this view.
Supervision has emerged as a protective factor inde-
pendent of seizure control, suggesting that it is not
just a surrogate marker for epilepsy control. A study
of SUDEP in a residential school for children with
epilepsy who were closely supervised at night and
carefully monitored after a seizure found a lower
SUDEP incidence and no witnessed deaths during

term time.13 Alterations of lifestyle may reduce the
risk of SUDEP, and caregivers need to be advised of
the action that they should take on witnessing a
seizure, such as placing the individual in the recov-
ery position, checking on respiration, and maintain-
ing a vigil in the postictal phase.
