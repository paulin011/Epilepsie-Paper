Abstract

Background: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) has emerged as a viable and valuable care
delivery method to improve chronic disease management. In light of the high prevalence and
substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), this systematic review examines
the cost and cost-effectiveness of using RPM to manage CVD in the United States.
Methods: We systematically searched databases to identify potentially relevant research. Find-
ings were synthesized for cost and cost-effectiveness by economic study type with consideration
of study perspective, intervention, clinical outcome, and time horizon. The methodological
quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Economic Evaluations.
Results: Thirteen articles with fourteen studies published between 2011 and 2021 were included
in the final review. Studies from the provider perspective with a narrow scope of cost compo-
nents identified higher costs and similar effectiveness for the RPM group relative to the usual
care group. However, studies from payer and healthcare sector perspectives indicate better
clinical effectiveness of RPM relative to usual care, with two cost-utility analysis studies
suggesting that RPM relative to usual care is a cost-effective tool for CVD management even
at the conservative $50,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year threshold. Additionally, all model-
based studies revealed that RPM is cost-effective in the long run.
Conclusions: Full economic evaluations identified RPM as a potentially cost-effective tool,
particularly for long-term CVD management. In addition to the current literature, rigorous
economic analysis with a broader perspective is needed in evaluating the value and economic
sustainability of RPM.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), as a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, are the
leading cause of death globally for all sex, race, and ethnicity groups; approximately 17.9 million
people die each year from CVDs (1). In the United States (US), about half of adults suffer from
CVDs, including hypertension (2;3). Remote patient monitoring (RPM), as a patient-centered
healthcare delivery method, has emerged for managing CVD at home (4;5). Integrated with
technology for data transition, RPM patients collect their health information, for example, weight,
blood pressure (BP), blood glucose, and heart rate, at home through personal health devices and
send it to healthcare facilities so that medical providers at the point of care can closely monitor the
patient health status (5;6). Many systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated short-
and long-term effectiveness of RPM in improving chronic CVD care management, including
better quality of life, faster clinical event detection, less re-hospitalization, and lower mortality rates
(7–11). Recognizing the effectiveness of RPM in managing CVD, the American Heart Association
(AHA) published guidance on RPM implementation to encourage the use of RPM for better CVD
outcomes (4). Also, in 2018, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued CPT codes
to reimburse providers for delivering RPM services to patients, and further coverage for RPM
services has been added in its recently proposed 2022 Physician Fee Schedule (12;13).

Aside from the effectiveness of managing CVD, it is critical to evaluate the related economic
costs. According to an AHA report from 2018, the medical costs related to CVD are expected to
more than triple by 2035 (14), which implies that the US is experiencing an unsustainable health
expenditure growth for CVD. However, though the importance of economic sustainability of

RPM for CVD management has gained attention, less has been
systematically reviewed and synthesized across the studies con-
ducted. Given the lack of clear information about the cost impli-
cations of RPM for CVD management and the complexity and
uniqueness of the US healthcare system, this review aims to exam-
ine the economic cost and cost-effectiveness of RPM compared to
usual care for CVD management in the US.

independent reviewers (YZ and MTP) for assessment against the
inclusion criteria. The full text of selected studies was assessed in
detail against the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers
(YZ and MTP). Disagreements during any selection stage were
resolved through discussion between all study members. All screen-
ings were completed through Rayyan (20), a free online systematic
review data management software.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted following the JBI method-
ology for systematic reviews of economic evidence in accordance
with a published protocol (15;16), associated registration on PROS-
PERO (CRD42021270621), and written following PRISMA report-
ing guidelines.

Search strategy

We aimed to find both published and unpublished studies. The
databases searched included PubMed (NIH), Embase (Embase.
com), Web of Science (Clarivate), CINAHL (ebsco.com), and Sco-
pus (Elsevier). Sources of unpublished studies and gray literature
searched included Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(Wiley), National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database
(York, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination), ClinicalTrails.gov,
and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry. The search strategies
for all searched databases and information sources are listed in
Supplementary Table 1. The search strategy, including all identified
keywords and index terms, was adapted for each included database
and/or information source. A hand search was completed, which
included a review of the included articles’ references and explor-
ation of related articles identified.

Studies published in English from 1 January 2011 to 8 November
2021 were considered for inclusion. The limits of publication dates
were based on historically impactful federal decisions. Throughout
the previous decade, technologies associated with RPM develop-
ment were promoted with healthcare reforms and federal legisla-
tion. The National Broadband Plan by the Federal Communications
Commission in 2010 facilitated medical technology advancement
and the development of technology-based health services (17). As
such, the date limit of this review will be set starting from 2011.

Eligibility criteria

A PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Out-
comes) was used for study selection. Articles were eligible for inclu-
sion if they involved a chronic CVD patient population in the US,
comparing RPM, or similar health delivery models, with usual care in
terms of costs or in conjunction with other health benefit outcomes.
This review considered studies evaluating the costs from all time
horizons, for example, short-term and long-term, and all perspec-
tives, for example, payer, provider, and healthcare sectors (18). Full
economic evaluation studies, such as cost-effectiveness analysis
(CEA), cost-utility analysis (CUA), and cost–benefit analysis
(CBA), as well as partial economic evaluation studies, such as cost
analysis, cost-description studies, and cost-outcome descriptions,
were considered for inclusion in the review (15;19).

Study selection

Following the search, all identified citations were collated and
uploaded into EndNote V20 (Clarivate Analytics, PA, USA), and
duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were screened by two

Assessment of methodological quality

Eligible studies were critically appraised by two independent
reviewers (YZ and MTP) at the study level for methodological
quality following the detailed checklist for assessing economic
evaluation from Drummond et al. (19) and summarized using
standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs
Institute for Economic Evaluation (15). Any disagreements that
arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion or
with all study members.

Data extraction and analysis

Data were extracted from studies included in the review by two
independent reviewers (YZ and MTP) using a modified JBI data
extraction tool for economic evaluation (15), to consider key elem-
ents of both partial and full economic evaluations. The data
extracted include specific details about the participants, study
design, interventions, comparators, study perspectives, time hori-
zons, analysis type, clinical effectiveness, and costs and cost-
effectiveness outcomes of significance to the review objective
(16). If an article reported results from multiple studies, we
extracted data for all eligible studies and analyzed them separately.
If a study reported multiple outcomes, we extracted the results for a
broader range of costs, a more commonly used effectiveness out-
come, and a longer time horizon. In conducting economic analysis,
it is imperative to have a clear study perspective (19). Two reviewers
inferred the study perspective and the year of cost data, if it was not
explicitly stated in the article. Any disagreements that arose
between the reviewers were resolved through discussion.

All extracted cost data were converted to 2021 US dollars ($)
using a web-based tool developed by the Campbell and Cochrane
Economics Methods Group and the Evidence for Policy and Prac-
tice Information and Coordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre) (21).
Results of included studies were synthesized by economic analysis
types and were interpreted considering study perspectives, inter-
vention, health outcomes, and time horizons. Data from full eco-
nomic evaluations are summarized using JBI Dominance Ranking
Matrix (15), which ranks studies by cost and health benefit and
synthesizes them into three implication categories: reject interven-
tion, unclear, and favor intervention.

Results

Study inclusion

As shown in the PRISMA flowchart (Figure 1), 899 records were
identified from databases and registries. After the exclusion of
271 duplicates, 628 titles and abstracts were screened. Among the
fifty-four potentially relevant studies, eleven clinical trial registra-
tions did not have final reports after contacting principal investi-
gators. Forty-three full-text reviews revealed thirty-one papers
excluded for ineligible publication type, patient populations, inter-
ventions, or outcomes. One additional article was included through
hand searching. One article reported two eligible independent

studies, so we consider them as separate studies in the analysis (22).
Consequently,
thirteen articles, with fourteen studies, were
included in the final review for data extraction and synthesis.
Among them, eight conducted partial economic evaluations, in
which data about treatment costs and effectiveness were presented
without an integrated analysis of cost and effectiveness (22–28).
The remaining six studies conducted full economic evaluations,
three contained CEA (29–31), two contained CUA (32;33), and one
contained CBA and return on investment analysis (28).

perspective clearly stated (24;27;29–32). Four studies did not
have a clear study perspective; therefore, it was unclear if any
relevant costs or outcomes were omitted (25;26;33;34). All
included studies compared clinical effectiveness between the
intervention and comparator groups with costs and effectiveness
data measured accurately and credibly. Four full economic
evaluations adjusted costs and outcomes for differential timing
(28;30;32;33). The detailed methodological quality assessment is
provided in Supplementary Table 2.

Methodological quality

Characteristics of included studies

Overall, seventy-three percent of the quality criteria were met.
Among all the included articles, full economic evaluations had
higher methodological quality than partial economic evalu-
ations; on average, full economic evaluations met eighty-nine
percent of the quality criteria, while partial economic evalu-
ations met sixty-one percent. Two partial and four full economic
evaluations had a well-defined question along with a study

Table 1 provides an overview of the study characteristics and
primary results. The clinical efficacy data in the included studies
were from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (22–25;27;29;30;32–
34) and quasi-experimental studies (22;26;31;35). Generally, this
systematic review included a total of 3,915 actual patients, with
2,304 in RPM intervention groups and 200,000 simulated patients
with 100,000 in the RPM intervention group.

Though RPM served as the basic concept of all interventions in
this review, studies may have additive interventional medical ser-
vices. Five studies, two partial and three full economic evaluations,
had an intervention group of RPM with medication management
(24;27;29;30;34). Two studies conducting partial economic evalu-
ations based on the same RCT had intervention groups of RPM
with behavioral management and RPM with behavioral and medi-
cation combined management (24;27). In addition, two studies
were based on the same RCT of an implantable wireless pulmonary
artery pressure remote monitor (32;33).

The economic impact of RPM for a time horizon of half to two
years was assessed in nine studies (22;25–27;29–31;35). Two partial
and three full economic evaluations were conducted for a longer
time horizon between two and seven years, of which three full
economic evaluations were model based, consisting of two CUAs
and one CBA (32–34). Moreover, the included studies were of
varying perspectives,
including nine studies from the payer
(22;23;25;26;28;32;33;35), two studies from the provider (30;31),

two studies from the Veteran Affairs (VA) healthcare system
(24;27), and one study from the healthcare sector perspective
(29). The relevant types of costs used in each study with its study
perspective are summarized in Table 2. Certain types of costs were
excluded in the cost aggregates if their difference was not significant
between RPM and comparator groups.

Program costs

Three studies reported program costs such as costs of equipment
and medical
supplies, personnel, marketing, and overhead
(27;30;31). The equipment and supplies may consist of laptop
computers and accessories, home BP monitors, and telemedicine
devices for data transmission and their warranty, batteries for BP
monitors, and medication containers. The personnel costs were
calculated based on personnel time and relevant hourly wage, along
with additional benefits. Personnel time contained nurse time spent
receiving training, educating patients, implementing programs,

calling patients and preparing for calls, and physician time spent
reviewing medical charts and consulting with nurses. For RPM with
medication management, costs were considered for pharmacist
time spent receiving training, developing protocols, and providing
services, such as reviewing patient progress and medication
regimens, monitoring potential adverse events, and meeting with
physicians.

Table 3 displays the cost and cost-effectiveness of each study
inflated to 2021 US Dollars ($) by health benefit. Among the three
studies that reported program costs, one study from the VA
healthcare perspective found no difference in program costs and
treatment efficacy between RPM and the usual care group (27). In
comparison, the two studies from the provider perspective reported
higher costs for the RPM-only group with no difference in treat-
ment efficacy (30;31).

Medical costs

Inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient costs were the
most commonly considered components among included studies.

Medication costs were considered in four studies (27–29;32). Other
medical costs may include critical care, laboratory test, procedure,
radiology, evaluation/management/observation service, complica-
tion, and monitoring service. As opposed to the two studies from
the provider perspective that considered monitoring as a program
cost (30;31), two studies using the implantable device considered it
as a monthly cost to the payer (32;33). Among studies that reported
medical costs for the RPM-only intervention, seven partial eco-
nomic evaluation studies reported no significant difference in costs
between groups (22–27;35), and two full economic evaluation
studies reported that the RPM group costs more than the usual
care group (details can be found in Table 3) (32;33).

Cost-effectiveness

When considering costs and health outcomes jointly, the included
partial economic evaluations tend to favor the RPM intervention.
Maciejewsk et al. (24) and Nouryan et al. (25) reported that, with
the same costs, patients receiving RPMs had better BP control and
improved quality of life than usual care patients. Included partial

economic evaluations reported equal costs and efficacy between
RPM and usual care groups for hospitalization-related outcomes,
such as the number of readmission and readmission rate. In
assessing costs of BP control, two partial economic evaluations
based on the same RCT found no difference in associated costs
among groups (24;27); however, the one with a longer time
horizon identified all RPM groups as having better BP control
than the usual care group (21). The two partial economic evalu-
ations that evaluated the quality of care had differing results
(23;25).

Moreover, the results of full economic evaluations are summar-
ized using JBI Dominance Ranking Matrix. Table 4 shows the
synthesized results from two CEA and two CUA studies that
compared the RPM-only intervention with the usual care. The
RPM-only intervention was rejected in two CEA studies from the
provider perspective, due to higher costs and similar efficacy for
the RPM group relative to the usual care group. Both CUA studies
reported that the RPM group had higher costs and Quality-
Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) than usual care and showed unclear
implications; however, at a conservative threshold of $50,000 per
QALY, the CUA studies suggest that RPM relative to usual care is a
cost-effective tool for CVD management (32;33). Additionally,
Supplementary Table 3 shows the synthesized results for RPM with
medication management intervention. Two CEA studies found that
RPM with medication management led to higher costs and better
BP control (29;30), which were cost-effective at the willingness-to-
pay of $150,000 per QALY, and a CBA study found that avoiding
CVD events led to cost savings (34). Supplementary Table 4 shows
the synthesized results for studies with a time horizon over three

years. Among three full economic evaluations with at least a three-
year time horizon, the CBAs favored RPM with medication man-
agement, and both CUAs favored RPM at the $50,000 per QALY
threshold (32;33).

Discussion

This systematic review aimed to assess the costs and cost-
effectiveness of RPM for CVD management in the US. Our review
included fourteen studies reported in thirteen articles comparing
RPM-based interventions with usual care in terms of cost and cost-
effectiveness for CVD management. Partial economic evaluations
found similar costs between RPM and usual care groups, while full
economic evaluations, using different outcomes and analysis
methods, suggested that RPM and RPM with medication manage-
ment are cost-effective in terms of QALYs, BP control, and redu-
cing the incidence of CVD events, especially in the long run. To
fully understand the economic impact, it is essential to consider
long-term costs and clinical outcomes.

The present study is the first systematic review of the economic
impact of RPM for CVD management, focusing on the US health-
care system. A previous systematic review involved thirty-four
studies conducted in twelve countries for multiple chronic diseases
(36). Their results revealed that RPM is a highly cost-effective
intervention for hypertension and prevents high-cost health events
in the long run from a wide variety of perspectives, which is
consistent with our findings of studies from payer and healthcare
perspectives (36). However, our review includes a different set of
studies, including partial and full economic evaluations, invasive
and non-invasive RPM, and focused on CVD management in the
US context. When examining the cost-effectiveness of a program in
the US healthcare system context, it is important to consider the
healthcare provider perspective, which informs policymakers
regarding payer–provider partnerships. Program costs, referring
to costs incurred at the administrative level (37), are an essential
component of RPM-based interventions, especially for studies that
include the provider perspective. Two included full economic
evaluations revealed higher program costs of RPM compared to
usual care with additional monitor and data transmission devices as
well as nurse time and pharmacist time for training, service, and
communication with patients. In addition, medication costs con-
stitute an important portion of assessing the cost-effectiveness of
health interventions, which is a cost borne at least partly by patients
in the US, depending on the payer type. RPM with medication
management can enhance medication adherence and ultimately
reduce healthcare costs (38); therefore, it is important to consider
medication costs in economic analysis. We recommend that future
economic studies of RPM should be conducted rigorously with a
broader perspective, such as societal perspective to include the
provider perspective, considering program costs, and the patient
perspective, considering medication costs (39).

Nevertheless, the study of Riley et al. (26) was the only one with
specified locations that included underserved rural communities
and Native American reservations. Though the clinical efficacy of
RPM has been addressed in rural areas and low-income popula-
tions (40), future evidence of RPM cost-effectiveness in under-
served populations is needed.

There are some limitations within our systematic review.
Although fourteen studies were included in the review, eight were
partial economic evaluations, providing lower quality evidence.
The heterogeneity of patient populations, varying study perspec-
tives, different health benefit outcomes, and the small number of

articles included make it challenging to draw conclusions in each
category and limit the generalizability of these findings.

Conclusions

This review summarizes current evidence of the economic impact of
RPM on CVD management in the US. The findings suggest that
RPM-based healthcare services can be more cost-effective than usual
care from the payer perspective for CVD management in terms of
QALYs, BP control, and fewer CVD events. This result can seem
encouraging for third-party payers. Given the current evidence of
clinical effectiveness, future efforts should seek to investigate the
economic sustainability of RPM for CVD management, considering
broader and varying perspectives with a longer-term view.
