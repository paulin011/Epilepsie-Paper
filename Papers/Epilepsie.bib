  abstract = {Purpose We investigated the prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and the risk factors associated with them. We also studied the seizure outcome in patients with IGEs. Methods In this retrospective study, all patients with a diagnosis of IGE were recruited at the epilepsy clinic at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, from 2008 through 2019. Age, gender, age at seizure onset, seizure type(s), EEG findings, and seizure outcome of all patients were registered. Results A total of 601 patients with IGE were studied; 516 patients (86\%) had GTCSs. The ROC curve showed that reporting GTCSs was significantly associated with the time since the start of the disease (P~=~.0001; area under the curve~=~0.71 [95\% CI: 0.66-0.76]; a cutoff point of 4~years [sensitivity~=~61\% and specificity~=~76\%]). Age at onset was 3.3~years later in patients with GTCSs compared with that in patients without GTCSs. Generalized spike-wave complexes during interictal EEG recording were more frequently observed among patients without GTCSs. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were significantly associated with experiencing seizure-related injuries. Valproate reduced the risk of experiencing GTCSs significantly (OR: 0.58; 95\% CI: 0.34-0.99; P~=~.04). Conclusion Generalized tonic-clonic seizures do not affect the seizure outcome in patients with IGEs per se, but how we manage them significantly affects the seizure outcome in these patients. Failure to prescribe valproate for women with IGE, particularly when another first-line treatment has failed, may not be in a patient's best interests.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain characterized by an enduring (i.e., persisting) predisposition to generate seizures, unprovoked by any immediate central nervous system insult, and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of seizure recurrences. Epilepsy affects both sexes and all ages with worldwide distribution. The prevalence and the incidence of epilepsy are slightly higher in men compared to women and tend to peak in the elderly, reflecting the higher frequency of stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and tumors in this age-group. Focal seizures are more common than generalized seizures both in children and in adults. The etiology of epilepsy varies according to the sociodemographic characteristics of the affected populations and the extent of the diagnostic workup, but a documented cause is still lacking in about 50\% of cases from high-income countries (HIC). The overall prognosis of epilepsy is favorable in the majority of patients when measured by seizure freedom. Reports from low/middle-income countries (LMIC; where patients with epilepsy are largely untreated) give prevalence and remission rates that overlap those of HICs. As the incidence of epilepsy appears higher in most LMICs, the overlapping prevalence can be explained by misdiagnosis, acute symptomatic seizures and premature mortality. Studies have consistently shown that about one-half of cases tend to achieve prolonged seizure remission. However, more recent reports on the long-term prognosis of epilepsy have identified differing prognostic patterns, including early and late remission, a relapsing-remitting course, and even a worsening course (characterized by remission followed by relapse and unremitting seizures). Epilepsy per se carries a low mortality risk, but significant differences in mortality rates are expected when comparing incidence and prevalence studies, children and adults, and persons with idiopathic and symptomatic seizures. Sudden unexplained death is most frequent in people with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, and drug refractory epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy affects more than 50 million people worldwide, making it one of the world’s most prevalent neurological diseases. The main symptom of epilepsy is seizures, which occur abruptly and can cause serious injury or death. The ability to predict the occurrence of an epileptic seizure could alleviate many risks and stresses people with epilepsy face. We formulate the problem of detecting preictal (or pre-seizure) with reference to normal EEG as a precursor to incoming seizure. To this end, we developed several supervised deep learning approaches model to identify preictal EEG from normal EEG. We further develop novel unsupervised deep learning approaches to train the models on only normal EEG, and detecting pre-seizure EEG as an anomalous event. These deep learning models were trained and evaluated on two large EEG seizure datasets in a person-specific manner. We found that both supervised and unsupervised approaches are feasible; however, their performance varies depending on the patient, approach and architecture. This new line of research has the potential to develop therapeutic interventions and save human lives.},

  abstract = {Background: Smartwatches are widely adopted globally for tracking health metrics, offering potential for enhancing individual healthcare and public health efforts. Continuous use of the devices and users’ willingness to share the data collected are critical to realizing their full benefits. Objective: To identify key factors that determine continuous smartwatch use and users’ comfort levels in sharing health data with healthcare providers and public health authorities. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of current and past smartwatch users (age {$>$}18 years) was conducted to assess determinants of continuous use based on the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) and user comfort levels with different data-sharing methods. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate relationships between habit formation, satisfaction, perceived enjoyment, and perceived usefulness with continuous use.  Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests were used to analyse user comfort in sharing data, comparing non-internet versus internet-based sharing methods and fully versus partially anonymized data. Results: : 273 responses were analyzed, with participants aged 18-65 years (mean = 35.6, SD = 11.7). The result indicates that continuous use of smart watches is explained by habit (β = 0.35; P {$<$} .001) and satisfaction (β = 0.38; P {$<$} .001), which is in turn explained by perceived usefulness (β = 0.38; P {$<$} .001), perceived enjoyment (β = 0.32; P {$<$} .001), confirmation (β = 0.24, P {$<$} .001), and perceived usability (β = 0.10; P =.03).  Smartwatch users preferred non-internet-based sharing options (Z = -5.793, p {$<$} .001) when sharing data with their physician. Similarly, users were more comfortable sharing fully anonymized data with public health authorities than partially anonymized data (Z = -3.592, p {$<$} .001). Conclusions: Habit formation and satisfaction emerged as pivotal drivers of continuous intention to use smartwatches, emphasizing the need for features that foster integration into daily routine and a rewarding user experience. Preferences for non-internet-based data sharing with physicians highlights privacy concerns which must be addressed to build user’s trust. By aligning device features and data-sharing protocols with user preferences, manufacturers, healthcare providers, and policymakers can enhance user engagement and maximize the potential of smartwatches to support individual health management and public health initiatives.},

  abstract = {Summary Objectives Secondary generalized tonic?clonic seizures (SGTCS) are among the most severe forms of seizures, and the main risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Whether some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) might be more efficacious than others on SGTCS in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy thus represents an important clinical issue for which no data are currently available. Methods We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of adjunctive AED in which information on efficacy outcomes (i.e., responder rate and/or frequency per 28~days relative to baseline) were available both for all seizure types and for SGTCS. The primary analysis evaluated the efficacy of AEDs on all types of seizure and on SGTCS by comparing the responder rates for AED and for placebo. Results Responder rate was available both for all seizure types and for SGTCS in 13 of the 72 eligible trials, evaluating 7 AEDs. Only three AEDs?lacosamide, perampanel and topiramate?showed greater efficacy than placebo. However, confidence intervals of relative risks overlapped for all AEDs but pregabalin, which demonstrated significantly lower efficacy than lacosamide, perampanel, and topiramate. Moreover, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower relative risk of responder rate for SGTCS than for all seizure types, which appeared related to a greater response to placebo for this outcome. Significance Indirect comparison of AEDs using randomized placebo-controlled add-on trials does not support robust differences between AEDs to prevent SGTCS. Alternative designs for evaluation of therapeutic interventions in patients at risk for SGTCS-related complications are required.},

In particular, heart rate (HR) has become an important autonomic biomarker in seizure prediction. Based on that, a preliminary study is here proposed in order to inspect the behaviour of electrocardiogram (ECG) derived features in the period preceding epileptic seizures. The study took place using data from 1275 seizures collected from a set of 167 patients available in EPILEPSIAE database. The analysis was conducted considering three different variables: seizure type, seizure hour onset and vigilance state. The results did not reveal a clear effect of any of the three variables, assessed individually, in entire seizure set. Nevertheless, some evidence has been found that, for some seizures, it was possible to detected a consistent pattern of increase/decrease in feature magnitude before the onset. These patterns were revealed using the mean of RR intervals and the mean of the number of beats per minute.},

  abstract = {Objective To study the risk for injuries/accidents in people with newly diagnosed epileptic seizures in relation to comorbidities. Methods Between September 1, 2001, and August 31, 2008, individuals in northern Stockholm with incident unprovoked seizures (epilepsy; n = 2,130) were included in a registry. For every epilepsy patient, 8 individuals matched for sex and inclusion year (n = 16,992) were randomly selected as references from the population of the catchment area. Occurrence of injuries/accidents was monitored through the national patient and cause of death registers until December 31, 2013. These registers also provided information on comorbidities (e.g., brain tumor, stroke, psychiatric disease, diabetes mellitus). Results Injury/accident was demonstrated in 1,033 epilepsy cases and 6,202 references (hazard ratio [HR] 1.71, 95\% confidence interval 1.60–1.83). The excess risk was seen mainly during the first 2 years after diagnosis. Sex and educational status had no significant effect on HR. The risk was normal in children but increased in adults. Highest HR was seen for drowning, poisoning, adverse effect of medication, and severe traumatic brain injury. Compared to references without comorbidities, HR was 1.17 (1.07–1.28) in epilepsy without comorbidities, 4.52 (4.18–4.88) in references with comorbidities, and 7.15 (6.49–7.87) in epilepsy with comorbidities. Conclusion Presence of comorbidities should be considered when counseling patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy concerning risk for injuries/accidents. Early information is important, as the risk is highest during the first 2 years following seizure onset.},

  abstract = {This article presents an in-depth experimental study of Ensemble Deep Learning techniques on small datasets for the analysis of time-series data generated by wearable devices. Deep Learning networks generally require large datasets for training. In some health care applications, such as the real-time smartwatch-based fall detection, there are no publicly available, large, annotated datasets that can be used for training, due to the nature of the problem (i.e., a fall is not a common event). We conducted a series of offline experiments using two different datasets of simulated falls for training various ensemble models. Our offline experimental results show that an ensemble of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, combined by the stacking ensemble technique, outperforms a single RNN model trained on the same data samples. Nonetheless, fall detection models trained on simulated falls and activities of daily living performed by test subjects in a controlled environment, suffer from low precision due to high false-positive rates. In this work, through a set of real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the low precision can be mitigated via the collection of false-positive feedback by the end-users. The final Ensemble RNN model, after re-training with real-world user archived data and feedback, achieved a significantly higher precision without reducing much of the recall in a real-world setting.},

Methods:               EEG and ECG data for 21 patients with definite (n = 6) or probable (n = 15) SUDEP were compared with data from a group of 43 patients with refractory partial epilepsy. ECG abnormalities and heart rate (HR) changes were correlated with clinical data.                                         Results:               Fourteen patients died in their sleep; two were awake. Ictal maximal HR (90 seizures from 16 of 21 patients) was significantly higher in SUDEP (mean, 149 beats/min, BPM) than in comparison patients (mean, 126 BPM; p {$<$} 0.001). Greater increases in HR were associated with seizures arising from sleep (78 BPM increase) than from wakefulness (47 BPM; p {$<$} 0.001) in SUDEP, as compared with the non‐SUDEP group (52 BPM in sleep, 43 BPM in wakefulness; p = 0.27). Ictal cardiac repolarization and rhythm abnormalities occurred in 56\% of SUDEP (including two atrial fibrillation, two ventricular premature depolarizations, two marked sinus arrhythmia, two atrial premature depolarizations, one junctional escape, one ST‐segment elevation), and 39\% of comparison patients (p = 0.39). No specific seizure onset (laterality or lobe) was associated with SUDEP.                                         Conclusions:               This study reveals, for the first time, evidence of increased autonomic stimulation (as measured by HR) associated with seizures, particularly in sleep, in patients with SUDEP, as compared with a clinically similar group of patients with refractory epilepsy.},

Arrhythmias, repolarization abnormalities, and PR and QT               C               intervals were determined for preictal (3 min), ictal, and postictal (3 min) periods for one or more seizures per patient. Parametric statistics were used for continuous variables, and nonparametric statistics were used for categoric variables.                                         Results               : Of the patients, 39\% had one or more abnormalities of rhythm and/or repolarization during or immediately after seizures. Abnormalities included asystole (one), atrial fibrillation (one), marked or moderate sinus arrhythmia (six), supraventricular tachycardia (one), atrial premature depolarizations (APDs; eight), ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs; two), and bundle‐branch block (three). Mean seizure duration was longer in patients with abnormalities than in those without (204 vs. 71 s; p {$<$} 0.001). Generalized tonic–clonic seizures were also associated with increased occurrence of ictal ECG abnormalities (p = 0.006) as compared with complex partial seizures. There were no clinically significant differences in mean preictal and ictal/postictal PR and QT               C               intervals.                                         Conclusions               : Cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities are common during seizures, particularly if they are prolonged or generalized, in intractable epilepsy. These abnormalities may contribute to SUDEP.},

  abstract = {A reliable seizure detection or prediction device can potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with epileptic seizures. Previous findings indicating alterations in cardiac activity during seizures suggest the usefulness of cardiac parameters for seizure detection or prediction. This study aims to examine available studies on seizure detection and prediction based on cardiac parameters using non‐invasive wearable devices. The Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to systematically search according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis guidelines. Human studies that evaluated seizure detection or prediction based on cardiac parameters collected using wearable devices were included. The QUADAS‐2 tool and proposed standards for validation for seizure detection devices were used for quality assessment. Twenty‐four articles were identified and included in the analysis. Twenty studies evaluated seizure detection algorithms, and four studies focused on seizure prediction. Most studies used either a wrist‐worn or chest‐worn device for data acquisition. Among the seizure detection studies, cardiac parameters utilized for the algorithms mainly included heart rate (HR) (n\,=\,11) or a combination of HR and heart rate variability (HRV) (n\,=\,6). HR‐based seizure detection studies collectively reported a sensitivity range of 56\%‐100\% and a false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.02‐8/h, with most studies performing retrospective validation of the algorithms. Three of the seizure prediction studies retrospectively validated multimodal algorithms, combining cardiac features with other physiological signals. Only one study prospectively validated their seizure prediction algorithm using HRV extracted from ECG data collected from a custom wearable device. These studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using cardiac parameters for seizure detection and prediction with wearable devices, with varying algorithmic performance. Many studies are in the proof‐of‐principle stage, and evidence for real‐time detection or prediction is currently limited. Future studies should prioritize further refinement of the algorithm performance with prospective validation using large‐scale longitudinal data.},

However, the reliability of diagnoses provided by these non-approved medical devices remains uncertain. This study addresses the problem of assessing the measurement accuracy of heart rate recordings from wearable devices in both controlled and uncontrolled environments. Previous research has focused on evaluating accuracy in controlled settings, neglecting the impact of external factors on device performance. We conducted a comparative study with ten healthy individuals, recording heart rates during indoor cycling and outdoor activities. Participants wore two out of three tested smartwatches (Apple Watch Ultra, Garmin Enduro 2, Polar Pacer Pro) alongside a Polar H10 chest strap as a reference device. Our findings provide evidence that the Apple Watch Ultra and the Garmin Enduro 2 are particularly resistant to external factors that can occur during regular cycling activities.},

  abstract = {Background Remote patient monitoring (RPM) has emerged as a viable and valuable care delivery method to improve chronic disease management. In light of the high prevalence and substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), this systematic review examines the cost and cost-effectiveness of using RPM to manage CVD in the United States. Methods We systematically searched databases to identify potentially relevant research. Findings were synthesized for cost and cost-effectiveness by economic study type with consideration of study perspective, intervention, clinical outcome, and time horizon. The methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Economic Evaluations. Results Thirteen articles with fourteen studies published between 2011 and 2021 were included in the final review. Studies from the provider perspective with a narrow scope of cost components identified higher costs and similar effectiveness for the RPM group relative to the usual care group. However, studies from payer and healthcare sector perspectives indicate better clinical effectiveness of RPM relative to usual care, with two cost-utility analysis studies suggesting that RPM relative to usual care is a cost-effective tool for CVD management even at the conservative \$50,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year threshold. Additionally, all model-based studies revealed that RPM is cost-effective in the long run. Conclusions Full economic evaluations identified RPM as a potentially cost-effective tool, particularly for long-term CVD management. In addition to the current literature, rigorous economic analysis with a broader perspective is needed in evaluating the value and economic sustainability of RPM.},

  abstract = {Summary:               \enspace Purpose:               To determine the prevalence of heart rate changes and ECG abnormalities during epileptic seizures and to determine the timing of heart rate changes compared to the first electrographic and clinical signs. To assess the risk factors for the occurrence of ECG abnormalities.                                         Methods:               We analyzed retrospectively 281 seizures in 81 patients with intractable epilepsy who had prolonged video‐EEG and two‐channel ECG. The nature and timing of heart rate changes compared to the electrographic and clinical seizure onset was determined. The ictal period (including one minute preictally and three minutes postictally) was analyzed for cardiac arrhythmias, conduction and repolarization abnormalities. Risk factors for cardiac abnormalities were investigated using parametric and non‐parametric statistics.                                         Results:               There was an increase in heart rate of at least 10 beats/minute in 73\% of seizures (93\% of patients) and this occurred most often around seizure onset. In 23\% of seizures (49\% of patients) the rate increase preceded both the electrographic and the clinical onset. ECG abnormalities were found in 26\% of seizures (44\% of patients). One patient had an asystole for 30 seconds. Long seizure duration increased the occurrence of ECG abnormalities. No other risk factor was found.                                         Conclusions:               Heart rate changes occur frequently and occur around the time or even before the earliest electrographic or clinical change. The change can clarify the timing of seizure onset and the specific rate pattern may be useful for seizure diagnosis and for automatic seizure detection. ECG abnormalities occur often and repeatedly in several seizures of the same patient.},
