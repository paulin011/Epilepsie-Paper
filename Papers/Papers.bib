  abstract = {Sleep position identification and monitoring is important in the context of certain healthcare conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnoea and epilepsy. Many studies have thoroughly investigated automatic sleep detection using various sensing channels located in optimum body locations. However, this has not been the case for detection using physiological data acquired from a single sensing channel on the neck. In certain healthcare contexts the neck can, however, be an attractive location despite being suboptimal for position monitoring; the reason being that it enables better extraction of more critical biomarkers from other sensing modalities, making possible multimodal monitoring using just one wearable. This work focuses on investigating methods of automatic sleep position detection using one wearable channel of accelerometry data sensed on the neck. Three different models are explored. These are based on: decision trees (DT), extra-trees classifier (ET) and long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM-NN). The paper also investigates for the first time what would be optimum design choices when considering that wearables are power and memory-constrained, but performance in the type of healthcare applications where a single location multimodal sensing is important must not be compromised. This includes looking into how changing the sampling rate and window sizes would affect the performance of the different models. It is demonstrated that a sampling rate as low as 5 Hz, and a window size as short as 1 second, still lead to high classification performance (around 0.945, 0.975 and 0.965 mean f1-score when using the DT, ET and LSTM-NN models, respectively, and at least 98\% average accuracy in all three models); and that the DT model occupies the least memory space (1.765 KB) and takes the least mean prediction time across all window sizes (around 0.8 ms).},

In this paper, we consider the well-established Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Lorenz features, and augment them with the electrocardiogram (ECG) multifractality features for the first time for seizure prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that incorporating multifractality features significantly enhances epileptic seizure prediction, with a 7.5\% improvement over using only HRV features and a 6.9\% improvement over using both HRV and Lorenz features. We also investigate the significance and impact of features in a seizure prediction Machine Learning (ML) model utilizing ECG signals, aiming to shed light on the intricate relationship between cardiac function and epileptic seizures. We employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), an interpretability framework, to interpret the prediction patterns. Based on our analysis, multifractality features are among the most important features in seizure prediction, capturing patterns that are not captured by the HRV and Lorenz features.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The occurrence of epileptic seizures in seemingly random patterns takes a great toll on persons with epilepsy and their families. Seizure prediction may markedly improve epilepsy management and, therefore, the quality of life of persons with epilepsy. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: Seizures tend to occur following complex non-random patterns. Circadian oscillators may contribute to the rhythmic patterns of seizure occurrence. Complex mathematical models based on chaos theory try to explain and even predict seizure occurrence. There are several patterns of epileptic seizure occurrence based on seizure location, seizure semiology, and hormonal factors, among others. These patterns are most frequently described for large populations. Inter-individual variability and complex interactions between the rhythmic generators continue to make it more difficult to predict seizures in any individual person. The increasing use of large databases and machine learning techniques may help better define patterns of seizure occurrence in individual patients. Improvements in seizure detection -such as wearable seizure detectors- and in seizure prediction -such as machine learning techniques and artificial as well as neuronal networks- promise to provide further progress in the field of epilepsy and are being applied to closed-loop systems for the treatment of epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: Seizures tend to occur following complex and patient-specific patterns despite their apparently random occurrence. A better understanding of these patterns and current technological advances may allow the implementation of closed-loop detection, prediction, and treatment systems in routine clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy affects 1\% of the global population, with approximately one-third of patients resistant to anti-seizure medications (ASMs), posing risks of physical injuries and psychological issues. Seizure prediction algorithms aim to enhance the quality of life for these individuals by providing timely alerts. This study presents a patient-specific seizure prediction algorithm applied to diverse databases (EPILEPSIAE, CHB-MIT, AES, and Epilepsy Ecosystem). The proposed algorithm undergoes a standardized framework, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, training, testing, and postprocessing. Various databases necessitate adaptations in the algorithm, considering differences in data availability and characteristics. The algorithm exhibited variable performance across databases, taking into account sensitivity, FPR/h, specificity, and AUC score.This study distinguishes between sample-based approaches, which often yield better results by disregarding the temporal aspect of seizures, and alarm-based approaches, which aim to simulate real-life conditions but produce less favorable outcomes. Statistical assessment reveals challenges in surpassing chance levels, emphasizing the rarity of seizure events. Comparative analyses with existing studies highlight the complexity of standardized assessments, given diverse methodologies and dataset variations. Rigorous methodologies aiming to simulate real-life conditions produce less favorable outcomes, emphasizing the importance of realistic assumptions and comprehensive, long-term, systematically structured datasets for future research.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain characterized by an enduring (i.e., persisting) predisposition to generate seizures, unprovoked by any immediate central nervous system insult, and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of seizure recurrences. Epilepsy affects both sexes and all ages with worldwide distribution. The prevalence and the incidence of epilepsy are slightly higher in men compared to women and tend to peak in the elderly, reflecting the higher frequency of stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and tumors in this age-group. Focal seizures are more common than generalized seizures both in children and in adults. The etiology of epilepsy varies according to the sociodemographic characteristics of the affected populations and the extent of the diagnostic workup, but a documented cause is still lacking in about 50\% of cases from high-income countries (HIC). The overall prognosis of epilepsy is favorable in the majority of patients when measured by seizure freedom. Reports from low/middle-income countries (LMIC; where patients with epilepsy are largely untreated) give prevalence and remission rates that overlap those of HICs. As the incidence of epilepsy appears higher in most LMICs, the overlapping prevalence can be explained by misdiagnosis, acute symptomatic seizures and premature mortality. Studies have consistently shown that about one-half of cases tend to achieve prolonged seizure remission. However, more recent reports on the long-term prognosis of epilepsy have identified differing prognostic patterns, including early and late remission, a relapsing-remitting course, and even a worsening course (characterized by remission followed by relapse and unremitting seizures). Epilepsy per se carries a low mortality risk, but significant differences in mortality rates are expected when comparing incidence and prevalence studies, children and adults, and persons with idiopathic and symptomatic seizures. Sudden unexplained death is most frequent in people with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, and drug refractory epilepsy.},

Until recently, technologies to enable such vision were lacking. However, wearable sensors and systems developed over the past decade have provided the tools to finally implement and deploy technology with the capabilities required by researchers in the field of patients' home monitoring. As discussed, potential applications of these technologies include the early diagnosis of diseases such as congestive heart failure, the prevention of chronic conditions such as diabetes, improved clinical management of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease, and the ability to promptly respond to emergency situations such as seizures in patients with epilepsy and cardiac arrest in subjects undergoing cardiovascular monitoring. Current research efforts are now focused on the development of more complex systems for home monitoring of individuals with a variety of preclinical and clinical conditions. Recent research on the clinical assessment of wearable technology promises to deliver methodologies that are expected to lead to clinical adoption within the next five to ten years. In particular, combining home robots and wearable technology is likely to be a key step toward achieving the goal of effectively monitoring patients in the home. These efforts to merge home robots and wearable technology are expected to enable a new generation of complex systems with the ability to monitor subjects' status, facilitate the administration of interventions, and provide an invaluable tool to respond to emergency situations.},

  abstract = {Using monitoring devices could help avoid injuries and even death. Currently, wearable sensors such as motion sensors and other sensors are used to detect when the patient is having a seizure and alarm their caregivers. However, the development phase of these devices requires labor-intensive work on labeling the collected data, resulting in difficulties in developing wearable monitoring devices. Thus, a more automated auxiliary method of labeling seizure data and a wearable device to detect seizures for daily monitoring use are necessary. We collected data from epileptics outside the hospital with our proposed bracelet. The subjects were asked to press the mark button after they had seizures. We also presented an automatically extraction and annotation of moving segments (EAMS) algorithm to exclude nonmoving segments. Then, we used a two-layer ensemble model (TLEM) using machine learning methods to classify seizures and non-seizure moving segments, which was designed to deal with imbalanced dataset. Then, we build two individual TLEM models separately for the overall (all day and night) seizure detection case and the night seizure detection case, owing to different imbalance of these datasets. The EAMS algorithm exclude 93.9\% raw inactive data. The TLEM model achieved 76.84\% sensitivity (SEN) and 97.28\% accuracy (ACU) for the overall case and achieved 94.57\% SEN and 91.37\% ACU for the night case. These results indicate that this bracelet can capture seizures efficiently, and our proposed TLEM has higher SEN and ACU than single-layer machine learning models.},

  abstract = {Wireless body sensors are increasingly used by clinicians and researchers in a wide range of applications, such as sports, space engineering, and medicine. Monitoring vital signs in real time can dramatically increase diagnosis accuracy and enable automatic curing procedures, e.g., detect and stop epilepsy or narcolepsy seizures. Breathing parameters are critical in oxygen therapy, hospital, and ambulatory monitoring, while the assessment of cough severity is essential when dealing with several diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this paper, a low-power wireless respiratory monitoring system with cough detection is proposed to measure the breathing rate and the frequency of coughing. This system uses wearable wireless multimodal patch sensors, designed using off-the-shelf components. These wearable sensors use a low-power nine-axis inertial measurement unit to quantify the respiratory movement and a MEMs microphone to record audio signals. Data processing and fusion algorithms are used to calculate the respiratory frequency and the coughing events. The architecture of each wireless patch-sensor is presented. In fact, the results show that the small 26.67 × 65.53 mm2 patch-sensor consumes around 12-16.2 mA and can last at least 6 h with a miniature 100-mA lithium ion battery. The data processing algorithms, the acquisition, and wireless communication units are described. The proposed network performance is presented for experimental tests with a freely behaving user in parallel with the gold standard respiratory inductance plethysmography.},

  abstract = {This companion paper to the introduction of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2017 classification of seizure types provides guidance on how to employ the classification. Illustration of the classification is enacted by tables, a glossary of relevant terms, mapping of old to new terms, suggested abbreviations, and examples. Basic and extended versions of the classification are available, depending on the desired degree of detail. Key signs and symptoms of seizures (semiology) are used as a basis for categories of seizures that are focal or generalized from onset or with unknown onset. Any focal seizure can further be optionally characterized by whether awareness is retained or impaired. Impaired awareness during any segment of the seizure renders it a focal impaired awareness seizure. Focal seizures are further optionally characterized by motor onset signs and symptoms: atonic, automatisms, clonic, epileptic spasms, or hyperkinetic, myoclonic, or tonic activity. Nonmotor-onset seizures can manifest as autonomic, behavior arrest, cognitive, emotional, or sensory dysfunction. The earliest prominent manifestation defines the seizure type, which might then progress to other signs and symptoms. Focal seizures can become bilateral tonic–clonic. Generalized seizures engage bilateral networks from onset. Generalized motor seizure characteristics comprise atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, myoclonic–atonic, myoclonic–tonic–clonic, tonic, or tonic–clonic. Nonmotor (absence) seizures are typical or atypical, or seizures that present prominent myoclonic activity or eyelid myoclonia. Seizures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified as motor, nonmotor, tonic–clonic, epileptic spasms, or behavior arrest. This “users’ manual” for the ILAE 2017 seizure classification will assist the adoption of the new system.},

Thus, ensuring the reliability of the decisions becomes essential in biomedical applications, while representing a major challenge considering battery-powered wearable technologies. Transferring the complex and energy-consuming computations to fogs or clouds can significantly reduce the energy consumption of wearable devices and result in a longer lifetime of these systems with a single battery charge. In this work, we aim to distribute the complex and energy-consuming machine-learning computations between the edge, fog, and cloud, based on the notion of self-awareness that takes into account the complexity and reliability of the algorithm. We also model and analyze the trade-offs in terms of energy consumption, latency, and performance of different Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. We consider the epileptic seizure detection problem as our real-world case study to demonstrate the importance of our proposed self-aware methodology.},

  abstract = {Objective: The present study proposes a new epileptic seizure prediction method through integrating heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and an anomaly monitoring technique. Methods: Because excessive neuronal activities in the preictal period of epilepsy affect the autonomic nervous systems and autonomic nervous function affects HRV, it is assumed that a seizure can be predicted through monitoring HRV. In the proposed method, eight HRV features are monitored for predicting seizures by using multivariate statistical process control, which is a well-known anomaly monitoring method. Results: We applied the proposed method to the clinical data collected from 14 patients. In the collected data, 8 patients had a total of 11 awakening preictal episodes and the total length of interictal episodes was about 57 h. The application results of the proposed method demonstrated that seizures in ten out of eleven awakening preictal episodes could be predicted prior to the seizure onset, that is, its sensitivity was 91\%, and its false positive rate was about 0.7 times per hour. Conclusion: This study proposed a new HRV-based epileptic seizure prediction method, and the possibility of realizing an HRV-based epileptic seizure prediction system was shown. Significance: The proposed method can be used in daily life, because the heart rate can be measured easily by using a wearable sensor.},

The main symptom of epilepsy is seizures, which occur abruptly and can cause serious injury or death. The ability to predict the occurrence of an epileptic seizure could alleviate many risks and stresses people with epilepsy face. We formulate the problem of detecting preictal (or pre-seizure) with reference to normal EEG as a precursor to incoming seizure. To this end, we developed several supervised deep learning approaches model to identify preictal EEG from normal EEG. We further develop novel unsupervised deep learning approaches to train the models on only normal EEG, and detecting pre-seizure EEG as an anomalous event. These deep learning models were trained and evaluated on two large EEG seizure datasets in a person-specific manner. We found that both supervised and unsupervised approaches are feasible; however, their performance varies depending on the patient, approach and architecture. This new line of research has the potential to develop therapeutic interventions and save human lives.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide and causes severe suffering. By providing opportunities for early intervention and seizure management, early detection of seizures can significantly enhance the quality of life for epileptic patients. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to explore non-invasive methodologies for predicting seizures. Recent advancements have highlighted the potential of Electrocardiogram (ECG), particularly Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis, as a valuable biomarker for seizure prediction. However, the effectiveness of these approaches can vary, making it difficult to select the most appropriate strategy. Unlike previous reviews that have mostly focused on methods related to HRV analysis from medical perspectives, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the machine learning techniques that have been applied to ECG data for predicting epileptic seizure attacks. In this study, we explore the relationship between the cardiovascular system and seizure activity, including the physiological effects of epileptic seizures and their implications for predictive modeling. Additionally, we provide a detailed comparison of available seizure prediction techniques, including a review of public datasets, common methodologies, key components, and evaluation metrics. Finally, the study highlights the strengths and limitations of various approaches while discussing existing challenges and future opportunities. We believe our work lays a basis for developing more sophisticated methods on utilizing the ECG signal for better seizure prediction.},

Continuous use of the devices and users’ willingness to share the data collected are critical to realizing their full benefits. Objective: To identify key factors that determine continuous smartwatch use and users’ comfort levels in sharing health data with healthcare providers and public health authorities. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of current and past smartwatch users (age {$>$}18 years) was conducted to assess determinants of continuous use based on the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) and user comfort levels with different data-sharing methods. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate relationships between habit formation, satisfaction, perceived enjoyment, and perceived usefulness with continuous use.  Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests were used to analyse user comfort in sharing data, comparing non-internet versus internet-based sharing methods and fully versus partially anonymized data. Results: : 273 responses were analyzed, with participants aged 18-65 years (mean = 35.6, SD = 11.7). The result indicates that continuous use of smart watches is explained by habit (β = 0.35; P {$<$} .001) and satisfaction (β = 0.38; P {$<$} .001), which is in turn explained by perceived usefulness (β = 0.38; P {$<$} .001), perceived enjoyment (β = 0.32; P {$<$} .001), confirmation (β = 0.24, P {$<$} .001), and perceived usability (β = 0.10; P =.03).  Smartwatch users preferred non-internet-based sharing options (Z = -5.793, p {$<$} .001) when sharing data with their physician. Similarly, users were more comfortable sharing fully anonymized data with public health authorities than partially anonymized data (Z = -3.592, p {$<$} .001). Conclusions: Habit formation and satisfaction emerged as pivotal drivers of continuous intention to use smartwatches, emphasizing the need for features that foster integration into daily routine and a rewarding user experience. Preferences for non-internet-based data sharing with physicians highlights privacy concerns which must be addressed to build user’s trust. By aligning device features and data-sharing protocols with user preferences, manufacturers, healthcare providers, and policymakers can enhance user engagement and maximize the potential of smartwatches to support individual health management and public health initiatives.},

Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) provide a closed-loop mechanism to accurately measure seizures. The erratic nature of seizures has drawn the attention where false detection could have catastrophic impact. This article discusses the vibration profile seizure identifier (VPSI) 2.0 where vibration profile analysis of an ictal patient is measured in real-time to classify seizures in an IoMT framework. The novel seizure detection model has been proposed for differentiating between multiple seizure types. The simultaneous equation (S.E) protocol is developed for noninvasive stigma-free monitoring of seizures for continual monitoring.

Further, the diagnosis of PNES involves high-cost hospital admission and monitoring using video-electroencephalogram machines. A wearable device that can monitor the patient in natural setting is a desired solution for diagnosis of convulsive PNES. A wearable device with an accelerometer sensor is proposed as a new solution in the detection and diagnosis of PNES. The seizure detection algorithm and PNES classification algorithm are developed. The developed algorithms are tested on data collected from convulsive epileptic patients. A very high seizure detection rate is achieved with 100\% sensitivity and few false alarms. A leave-one-out error of 6.67\% is achieved in PNES classification, demonstrating the usefulness of wearable device in the diagnosis of PNES.},

A number of experiments showed that deep learning systems fared better than traditional ones when it came to image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Several real-world applications and hierarchical systems have utilised transfer learning and deep learning algorithms for pattern recognition and classification tasks. Real-world machine learning settings, on the other hand, often do not support this assumption since training data can be difficult or expensive to get, and there is a constant need to generate high-performance beginners who can work with data from a variety of sources.

Data were recorded from fifteen patients (7 male, 5 female, 3 not noted, mean age 36.17~yrs), five of whom had a total of seven seizures. Patients were monitored in an inpatient setting using standard video-electroencephalography (vEEG), while also wearing sensors monitoring electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, electromyography, accelerometry, and audio signals (vocalizations). A systematic and detailed study was conducted to identify the sensors and the features derived from the non-cerebral sensors that contribute most significantly to separability of data acquired during seizures from non-seizure data. Post-processing of the data using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) shows that seizure data are strongly separable from non-seizure data based on features derived from the signals recorded. The mean area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for each individual patient that experienced a seizure during data collection, calculated using LDA, was 0.9682. The features that contribute most significantly to seizure detection differ for each patient. The results show that a multimodal approach to seizure detection using the specified sensor suite is promising in detecting seizures with both sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the study provides a means to quantify the contribution of each sensor and feature to separability. Development of a non-electroencephalography (EEG) based seizure detection device would give doctors a more accurate seizure count outside of the clinical setting, improving treatment and the quality of life of epilepsy patients.},

Whether some antiepileptic drugs (                 AED                 s) might be more efficacious than others on                 SGTCS                 in patients with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy thus represents an important clinical issue for which no data are currently available.                                                        Methods                                We performed a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials of adjunctive                 AED                 in which information on efficacy outcomes (i.e., responder rate and/or frequency per 28~days relative to baseline) were available both for all seizure types and for                 SGTCS                 . The primary analysis evaluated the efficacy of                 AED                 s on all types of seizure and on                 SGTCS                 by comparing the responder rates for                 AED                 and for placebo.                                                        Results                                Responder rate was available both for all seizure types and for                 SGTCS                 in 13 of the 72 eligible trials, evaluating 7                 AED                 s. Only three                 AED                 s—lacosamide, perampanel and topiramate—showed greater efficacy than placebo. However, confidence intervals of relative risks overlapped for all                 AED                 s but pregabalin, which demonstrated significantly lower efficacy than lacosamide, perampanel, and topiramate. Moreover, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower relative risk of responder rate for                 SGTCS                 than for all seizure types, which appeared related to a greater response to placebo for this outcome.

  abstract = {We present a time-independent gridded earthquake rate forecast for the European region including Turkey. The spatial component of our model is based on kernel density estimation techniques, which we applied to both past earthquake locations and fault moment release on mapped crustal faults and subduction zone interfaces with assigned slip rates. Our forecast relies on the assumption that the locations of past seismicity is a good guide to future seismicity, and that future large-magnitude events occur more likely in the vicinity of known faults. We show that the optimal weighted sum of the corresponding two spatial densities depends on the magnitude range considered. The kernel bandwidths and density weighting function are optimized using retrospective likelihood-based forecast experiments. We computed earthquake activity rates (a- and b-value) of the truncated Gutenberg–Richter distribution separately for crustal and subduction seismicity based on a maximum likelihood approach that considers the spatial and temporal completeness history of the catalogue. The final annual rate of our forecast is purely driven by the maximum likelihood fit of activity rates to the catalogue data, whereas its spatial component incorporates contributions from both earthquake and fault moment-rate densities. Our model constitutes one branch of the earthquake source model logic tree of the 2013 European seismic hazard model released by the EU-FP7 project ‘Seismic HAzard haRmonization in Europe’ (SHARE) and contributes to the assessment of epistemic uncertainties in earthquake activity rates. We performed retrospective and pseudo-prospective likelihood consistency tests to underline the reliability of our model and SHARE's area source model (ASM) using the testing algorithms applied in the collaboratory for the study of earthquake predictability (CSEP). We comparatively tested our model's forecasting skill against the ASM and find a statistically significant better performance for testing periods of 10–20yr. The testing results suggest that our model is a viable candidate model to serve for long-term forecasting on timescales of years to decades for the European region.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) are one of the key enablers of personalized health. However, IoT devices often have stringent constraints in terms of resources, e.g., energy budget, and, therefore, limited possibilities to exploit the state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Energy-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is proposed to tackle this challenge, by exploring lightweight DNN (DNN) architectures on a single IoT device, but not leveraging the inherently distributed nature of IoT systems. As a result, the joint optimization of DNN architectures and DNN computation partitioning/offloading has not been addressed to date. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware NAS framework for distributed IoT, aiming to search for distributed Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to maximize prediction performance subjected to Flash Memory (Flash), Random Access Memory (RAM), and energy constraints. Our framework searches for lightweight DNN architecture with optimized prediction performance and its corresponding optimal computation partitioning to offload the partial DNN from edge to fog in a joint optimization. We evaluate our framework in the context of two common health applications, namely, seizure detection and arrhythmia classification, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed joint optimization framework compared to NAS benchmarks.},

  abstract = {The focal and non-focal epilepsy is seen to be a chronic neurological brain disorder, which has affected \textbackslash approx 60 million people in the world. Hence, an early detection of the focal epileptic seizures can be carried out using the EEG signals, which act as a helpful tool for early diagnosis of epilepsy. Several EEG-based approaches have been proposed and developed to understand the underlying characteristics of the epileptic seizures. Despite the fact that the early results were positive, the proposed techniques cannot generate reproducible results and lack a statistical validation, which has led to doubts regarding the presence of the pre-ictal state. Various methodical and algorithmic studies have indicated that the transition to an ictal state is not a random process, and the build-up can lead to epileptic seizures. This study reviews many recently-proposed algorithms for detecting the focal epileptic seizures. Generally, the techniques developed for detecting the epileptic seizures were based on tensors, entropy, empirical mode decomposition, wavelet transform and dynamic analysis. The existing algorithms were compared and the need for implementing a practical and reliable new algorithm is highlighted. The research regarding the epileptic seizure detection research is more focused on the development of precise and non-invasive techniques for rapid and reliable diagnosis. Finally, the researchers noted that all the methods that were developed for epileptic seizure detection lacks standardization, which hinders the homogeneous comparison of the detector performance.},

Sensed data is wirelessly transmitted to the central control unit (CCU) that is associated with a remote base station. For benchmarking, medically certified sensors were employed to validate wearable sensors data. The sensor information can be ported in the cloud environment using CCU-based gateway with Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) modem capability. This mechanism is facilitating remote access to sensors information. To connect Radio Frequency (RF) units wirelessly, Zigbee mesh topology was adopted. In this way, they can be remotely overseen, managed and controlled by assigned staff.

This review explores their effectiveness and challenges across medical fields, including cardiology, respiratory health, neurology, endocrinology, orthopedics, oncology, and mental health. A thorough literature search identified studies focusing on wearable devices' impact on patient outcomes. In cardiology, wearables have proven effective for monitoring hypertension, detecting arrhythmias, and aiding cardiac rehabilitation. In respiratory health, these devices enhance asthma management and continuous monitoring of critical parameters. Neurological applications include seizure detection and Parkinson's disease management, with wearables showing promising results in improving patient outcomes. In endocrinology, wearable technology advances thyroid dysfunction monitoring, fertility tracking, and diabetes management. Orthopedic applications include improved postsurgical recovery and rehabilitation, while wearables help in early complication detection in oncology. Mental health benefits include anxiety detection, post-traumatic stress disorder management, and stress reduction through wearable biofeedback. In conclusion, wearable health devices offer transformative potential for managing chronic illnesses by enhancing real-time monitoring and patient engagement. Despite significant improvements in adherence and outcomes, challenges with data accuracy and privacy persist.

  abstract = {Objective Up to a third of patients with epilepsy fail to achieve satisfactory seizure control. A reliable method of predicting seizures would alleviate psychological and physical impact. Dysregulation in heart rate variability (HRV) has been found to precede epileptic seizures and may serve as an extracerebral predictive biomarker. This study aims to identify the preictal HRV dynamics and unveil the factors impeding the clinical application of ECG‐based seizure prediction. Methods Thirty‐nine adult patients (eight women; median age: 38, [IQR\,=\,31, 56.5]) with 252 seizures were included. Each patient had more than three recorded epileptic seizures, each at least 2 hours apart. For each seizure, one hour of ECG prior to seizure onset was analyzed and 97 HRV features were extracted from overlapping three‐minute windows with 10s stride. Two separate patient‐specific experiments were performed using a support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, the\,separability of training data was examined in a non‐causal trial. Secondly, the\,prediction was attempted in pseudo‐prospective conditions. Finally, visualized HRV data, clinical metadata, and results were correlated. Results The mean receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for the non‐causal experiment was 0.823 (±0.12), with 208 (82.5\%) seizures achieving an improvement over chance (IoC) classification score (p\,{$<$}\,0.05, Hanley \& McNeil test). In pseudo‐prospective classification, the ROC‐AUC was 0.569 (±0.17), and 86 (49.4\%) seizures were classified with IoC. Off‐sample optimized SVMs failed to improve performance. Major limiting factors identified include non‐stationarity, variable preictal duration and dynamics. The latter is expressed as both inter‐seizure onset zone (SOZ) and intra‐SOZ variability. Significance The pseudo‐prospective preictal classification achieving IoC in approximately half of tested seizures suggests the presence of genuine preictal HRV dynamics, but the overall performance does not warrant clinical application at present. The limiting factors identified are often overlooked in non‐causal study designs. While current deterministic prediction methods prove inadequate, probabilistic approaches may offer a promising alternative. Plain Language Summary Many patients with epilepsy suffer from uncontrollable seizures and would greatly benefit from a reliable seizure prediction method. Currently, no such system is available to meet this need. Previous studies suggest that changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) precede seizures by several minutes. In our work, we evaluated whether variations in heart rate could be used to predict epileptic seizures. Our findings indicate that we are still far from achieving results suitable for clinical application and highlight several limiting factors of present seizure prediction approaches.},

  abstract = {The distribution of seizure types was investigated in an epidemiological survey of 1,220 patients over 15 years of age. Classification of clinically dominant seizure type according to the International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was possible in 1,005 cases (82.5\%). Fifty-six percent of patients had partial seizures and 26.5\% had generalized seizures. Subclassification of partial seizures revealed simple partial seizures (SPS) in 7.5\% of the cases, complex partial seizures (CPS) in 23\%, and partial secondarily generalized seizures (PSGS) in 25.5\% of the cases. Simple partial onset was seen in 56\% of the patients with CPS, and impairment of consciousness at the onset occurred in the remaining 44\%. PSGS started with simple partial onset in 92\% of the cases and the remaining 8\% started with a complex partial phase. Tonic-clonic seizures were the most common type of generalized seizures, accounting for 23\% of all and 88\% of generalized seizures. Absence seizures were seen in 1\% of the cases. A single seizure type was observed in 737 patients (60\%) and the remaining 40\% had multiple seizure types. SPS, CPS, and absence seizures were most commonly combined with other seizure types. The study revealed that distribution of seizure type varies as a function of age. Although the present study finds ICES relevant, difficulties in its utilization in epidemiological context are demonstrated.},

  abstract = {The detection of nocturnal seizures in epilepsy patients is essential, both for the quick management of the seizure complications, and for the assessment of the ongoing seizure treatment. Traditional seizure detection products (e.g., wearables), however, are either very costly, uncomfortable, or unreliable. In this article, we then propose to utilize everyday WiFi signals for robust, fast, and noninvasive detection of nocturnal seizures. We first present a new and rigorous mathematical characterization for the spectral content/bandwidth of the WiFi signal, measured on a WiFi device placed near a sleeping patient, during different kinds of sleep motions: seizures, normal movements (e.g., posture adjustments), and breathing. Based on this mathematical modeling, we propose a novel pipeline for processing the received WiFi signals to robustly detect all nocturnal nonbreathing movements, and then classify them into normal body movements or seizures. In order to validate this, we carry out extensive experiments in seven different typical bedroom locations, where a set of 20 actors simulate the state of having seizures (a total of 260 instances), as well as normal sleep movements (a total of 410 instances). Our proposed system detects 93.85\% of the seizures with a mean response time (MRT) of only 5.69 s since the onset of the seizure. Moreover, our proposed system achieves a probability of false alarm of only 0.0097, when classifying normal sleep movements. Overall, our new mathematical modeling and experimental results show the great potential the ubiquitous WiFi signals have for detecting nocturnal seizures, which can provide better support for epilepsy patients and their caregivers.},

  abstract = {Wearable personalized health monitoring systems can offer a cost-effective solution for human health care. These systems must constantly monitor patients’ physiological signals and provide highly accurate, and quick processing and delivery of the vast amount of data within a limited power and area footprint. These personalized biomedical applications require sampling and processing multiple streams of physiological signals with a varying number of channels and sampling rates. The processing typically consists of feature extraction, data fusion, and classification stages that require a large number of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML) kernels. In response to these requirements, in this paper, a tiny, energy-efficient, and domain-specific manycore accelerator referred to as power-efficient nanoclusters (PENC) is proposed to map and execute the kernels of these applications. Simulation results show that the PENC is able to reduce energy consumption by up to 80\% and 25\% for DSP and ML kernels, respectively, when optimally parallelized. In addition, we fully implemented three compute-intensive personalized biomedical applications, namely, multichannel seizure detection, multiphysiological stress detection, and standalone tongue drive system (sTDS), to evaluate the proposed manycore performance relative to commodity embedded CPU, graphical processing unit (GPU), and field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based implementations. For these three case studies, the energy consumption and the performance of the proposed PENC manycore, when acting as an accelerator along with an Intel Atom processor as a host, are compared with the existing commercial off-the-shelf general-purpose, customizable, and programmable embedded platforms, including Intel Atom, Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, and NVIDIA TK1 advanced RISC machine -A15 and K1 GPU system on a chip. For these applications, the PENC manycore is able to significantly improve throughput and energy efficiency by up to 1872\textbackslash times and 276\textbackslash times , respectively. For the most computational intensive application of seizure detection, the PENC manycore is able to achieve a throughput of 15.22 giga-operations-per-second (GOPs), which is a 14\textbackslash times improvement in throughput over custom FPGA solution. For stress detection, the PENC achieves a throughput of 21.36 GOPs and an energy efficiency of 4.23 GOP/J, which is 14.87\textbackslash times and 2.28\textbackslash times better over FPGA implementation, respectively. For the sTDS application, the PENC improves a throughput by 5.45\textbackslash times and an energy efficiency by 2.37\textbackslash times over FPGA implementation.},

  abstract = {A wearable armband electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor has been used for daily life monitoring. The armband records three ECG channels, one electromyogram (EMG) channel, and tri-axial accelerometer signals. Contrary to conventional Holter monitors, the armband-based ECG device is convenient for long-term daily life monitoring because it uses no obstructive leads and has dry electrodes (no hydrogels), which do not cause skin irritation even after a few days. Principal component analysis (PCA) and normalized least mean squares (NLMS) adaptive filtering were used to reduce the EMG noise from the ECG channels. An artifact detector and an optimal channel selector were developed based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel using features that are related to the ECG signal quality. Mean HR was estimated from the 24-hour armband recordings from 16 volunteers in segments of 10 seconds each. In addition, four classical HR variability (HRV) parameters (SDNN, RMSSD, and powers at low and high frequency bands) were computed. For comparison purposes, the same parameters were estimated also for data from a commercial Holter monitor. The armband provided usable data (difference less than 10\% from Holter-estimated mean HR) during 75.25\%/11.02\% (inter-subject median/interquartile range) of segments when the user was not in bed, and during 98.49\%/0.79\% of the bed segments. The automatic artifact detector found 53.85\%/17.09\% of the data to be usable during the non-bed time, and 95.00\%/2.35\% to be usable during the time in bed. The HRV analysis obtained a relative error with respect to the Holter data not higher than 1.37\% (inter-subject median/interquartile range). Although further studies have to be conducted for specific applications, results suggest that the armband device has a good potential for daily life HR monitoring, especially for applications such as arrhythmia or seizure detection, stress assessment, or sleep studies.},

In particular, heart rate (HR) has become an important autonomic biomarker in seizure prediction. Based on that, a preliminary study is here proposed in order to inspect the behaviour of electrocardiogram (ECG) derived features in the period preceding epileptic seizures. The study took place using data from 1275 seizures collected from a set of 167 patients available in EPILEPSIAE database. The analysis was conducted considering three different variables: seizure type, seizure hour onset and vigilance state. The results did not reveal a clear effect of any of the three variables, assessed individually, in entire seizure set. Nevertheless, some evidence has been found that, for some seizures, it was possible to detected a consistent pattern of increase/decrease in feature magnitude before the onset. These patterns were revealed using the mean of RR intervals and the mean of the number of beats per minute.},

  abstract = {Low-power sensing technologies have emerged for acquiring physiologically indicative patient signals. However, to enable devices with high clinical value, a critical requirement is the ability to analyze the signals to extract specific medical information. Yet given the complexities of the underlying processes, signal analysis poses numerous challenges. Data-driven methods based on machine learning offer distinct solutions, but unfortunately the computations are not well supported by traditional DSP. This paper presents a custom processor that integrates a CPU with configurable accelerators for discriminative machine-learning functions. A support-vector-machine accelerator realizes various classification algorithms as well as various kernel functions and kernel formulations, enabling range of points within an accuracy-versus-energy and -memory trade space. An accelerator for embedded active learning enables prospective adaptation of the signal models by utilizing sensed data for patient-specific customization, while minimizing the effort from human experts. The prototype is implemented in 130-nm CMOS and operates from 1.2 V-0.55 V (0.7 V for SRAMs). Medical applications for EEG-based seizure detection and ECG-based cardiac-arrhythmia detection are demonstrated using clinical data, while consuming 273 μJ and 124 μJ per detection, respectively; this represents 62.4× and 144.7× energy reduction compared to an implementation based on the CPU. A patient-adaptive cardiac-arrhythmia detector is also demonstrated, reducing the analysis-effort required for model customization by 20 ×.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy, a chronic neuropsychiatric brain disorder characterized with recurrent seizures, is closely associated with abnormal neural communications within the brain. Despite that the phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) has been suggested to offer a new way to observe neural interactions during epilepsy, however, few studies pay attention to alterations of the epileptic functional brain network based on PAC, especially on the \textbackslash boldsymbol\textbackslash upbeta\textbackslash!\textbackslash!-\textbackslash!\textbackslash!\textbackslash upgamma PAC. Therefore, we use scalp electroencephalography (EEG) data of epileptic patients and the \textbackslash boldsymbol\textbackslash upbeta\textbackslash!\textbackslash!-\textbackslash!\textbackslash!\textbackslash upgamma PAC modulation index (MI) to construct functional brain networks to examine variations of neural interactions during different epileptic phases. Statistically, the findings show that between-channel MI values in the post-ictal period significantly increase compared to that in the pre-ictal period, and the between-channel MI value has a close association with the information of phase and amplitude provided by the channels. Importantly, in both the phase-amplitude and amplitude-phase functional brain networks, the average node degree is remarkably higher in the post-ictal period than that in the pre-ictal period, whereas the characteristic path length in the ictal and post-ictal periods is significantly lower than that in the pre-ictal period. Besides, the average betweenness centrality in the post-ictal period is remarkably higher than that in the ictal period. Interestingly, the positive correlations between within-channel MI values and between-channel MI values can be observed during the pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal periods.

  abstract = {Epilepsy as a common disease of the nervous system, with high incidence, sudden and recurrent characteristics. Therefore, timely prediction of seizures and intervention treatment can significantly reduce the accidental injury of patients and protect the life and health of patients. Epilepsy seizures is the result of temporal and spatial evolution, Existing deep learning methods often ignore its spatial features, in order to make better use of the temporal and spatial characteristics of epileptic EEG signals. We propose a CBAM-3D CNN-LSTM model to predict epilepsy seizures. First, we apply short-time Fourier transform(STFT) to preprocess EEG signals. Secondly, the 3D CNN model was used to extract the features of preictal stage and interictal stage from the preprocessed signals. Thirdly, Bi-LSTM is connected to 3D CNN for classification. Finally CBAM is introduced into the model. Different attention is given to the data channel and space to extract key information, so that the model can accurately extract interictal and pre-ictal features. Our proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 97.95\%, a sensitivity of 98.40\%, and a false alarm rate of 0.017 h−1 on 11 patients from the public CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset.

  abstract = {Epilepsy affects millions worldwide, posing significant challenges due to the erratic and unexpected nature of seizures. Despite advancements, existing seizure prediction techniques remain limited in their ability to forecast seizures with high accuracy, impacting the quality of life for those with epilepsy. This research introduces the Coherence-based Seizure Prediction (CoSP) method, which integrates coherence analysis with deep learning to enhance seizure prediction efficacy. In CoSP, electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are divided into 10-second segments to extract channel pairwise coherence. This coherence data is then used to train a four-layer convolutional neural network to predict the probability of being in a preictal state. The predicted probabilities are then processed to issue seizure warnings. CoSP was evaluated in a pseudo-prospective setting using long-term iEEG data from ten patients in the NeuroVista seizure advisory system. CoSP demonstrated promising predictive performance across a range of preictal intervals (4 to 180 minutes). CoSP achieved a median Seizure Sensitivity (SS) of 0.79, a median false alarm rate of 0.15 per hour, and a median Time in Warning (TiW) of 27\%, highlighting its potential for accurate and reliable seizure prediction. Statistical analysis confirmed that CoSP significantly outperformed chance (p = 0.001) and other baseline methods (p {$<$}0.05) under similar evaluation configurations.},

  abstract = {Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients typically require surgical intervention or neurostimulation. Therefore, accurate localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is essential for effective clinical intervention. Although some physiologically meaningful parameters of neural computational models show substantial differences across brain regions during seizures, few studies pay attention to applying these model parameters to SOZ localization. To investigate whether the parameter can be used for accurate SOZ localization, the unscented kalman filter (UKF) is employed to estimate the excitatory-inhibitory balance parameter c from the Z6 neural computational model using DRE patients' electrocorticography (ECoG). The results indicate that this parameter follows a unimodal distribution during the pre-ictal period and the post-ictal period, while exhibiting a bimodal distribution during the ictal period. Then, the distribution of this parameter is combined with machine learning methods, and a bagged tree classifier is constructed to localize the SOZ. The classification results demonstrate that the classifier based on parameter distributions exhibits excellent performance, particularly during the post-ictal period, with an average accuracy of 91.60\% . Interestingly, SOZ localization is more accurate when no lesions are detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to when lesions are present. Finally, the model parameter distributions of the SOZs are utilized to predict the outcome of epilepsy surgery. Of note, the results demonstrate that the parameter distribution accurately predicts surgical outcomes with an average accuracy of 92.56\% . These findings suggest that the distribution of neural computational model parameters may serve as biomarkers for SOZ localization and epilepsy surgery outcome prediction, providing valuable support and assistance for clinical decision-making.},

  abstract = {The most critical burden for People with Epilepsy (PwE) is represented by seizures, the unpredictability of which severely impacts quality of life. The design of real-time warning systems that can detect or even predict ictal events would enhance seizure management, leading to high benefits for PwE and their caregivers. In the past, various research works highlighted that seizure onset is anticipated by significant changes in autonomic cardiac control, which can be assessed through heart rate variability (HRV). This manuscript conducted a scoping review of the literature analyzing HRV-based methods for detecting or predicting ictal events. An initial search on the PubMed database returned 402 papers, 72 of which met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. These results suggest that seizure detection is more accurate in neonatal and pediatric patients due to more significant autonomic modifications during the ictal transitions. In addition, conventional metrics are often incapable of capturing cardiac autonomic variations and should be replaced with more advanced methodologies, considering non-linear HRV features and machine learning tools for processing them. Finally, studies investigating wearable systems for heart monitoring denoted how HRV constitutes an efficient biomarker for seizure detection in patients presenting significant alterations in autonomic cardiac control during ictal events.},

  abstract = {This article presents an in-depth experimental study of Ensemble Deep Learning techniques on small datasets for the analysis of time-series data generated by wearable devices. Deep Learning networks generally require large datasets for training. In some health care applications, such as the real-time smartwatch-based fall detection, there are no publicly available, large, annotated datasets that can be used for training, due to the nature of the problem (i.e., a fall is not a common event). We conducted a series of offline experiments using two different datasets of simulated falls for training various ensemble models. Our offline experimental results show that an ensemble of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, combined by the stacking ensemble technique, outperforms a single RNN model trained on the same data samples. Nonetheless, fall detection models trained on simulated falls and activities of daily living performed by test subjects in a controlled environment, suffer from low precision due to high false-positive rates. In this work, through a set of real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the low precision can be mitigated via the collection of false-positive feedback by the end-users. The final Ensemble RNN model, after re-training with real-world user archived data and feedback, achieved a significantly higher precision without reducing much of the recall in a real-world setting.},

  abstract = {Freezing of Gait (FoG) is a common motor-related impairment among Parkinson's disease patients, which substantially reduces their quality of life and puts them at risk of falls. These patients benefit from wearable FoG detection systems that provide timely biofeedback cues and hence help them regain control over their gait. Unfortunately, the systems proposed thus far are bulky and obtrusive when worn. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the first integration of an FoG detection system into a single sensor node. To achieve such an integration, features with low computational load are selected and dedicated hardware is designed that limits area and memory utilization. Classification is achieved with a neural network that is capable of learning in real time and thus allows the system to adapt to a patient during runtime. A small form factor FPGA implements the feature extraction and classification, whereas a custom PCB integrates the system into a single node. The system fits into a 4.5 × 3.5 × 1.5 cm3 housing case, weighs 32 g, and achieves 95.6\% sensitivity and 90.2\% specificity when adapted to a patient. Biofeedback cues are provided either through auditory or somatosensory means and the system can remain operational for longer than 9 h while providing cues. The proposed system is highly competitive in terms of classification performance and excels with respect to wearability and real-time patient adaptivity.},

  abstract = {Objective: This paper presents a data-driven method for estimating the memory order (the average length of the statistical dependence of a given sample on previous samples) of a recorded electrocorticography (ECoG) sequence. Methods: The proposed inference method is based on the relationship between the loss in predicting the next sample in a time-series and the dependence of this sample on the previous samples. Specifically, the memory order is estimated to be the number of past samples that minimize the least squares error (LSE) in predicting the next sample. To deal with the lack of an analytical model for ECoG recordings, the proposed method combines a collection of different predictors, thereby achieving LSE at least as low as the LSE achieved by each of the different predictors. Results: ECoG recordings from six patients with epilepsy were analyzed, and the empirical cumulative density functions (ECDFs) of the memory orders estimated from these recordings were generated, for rest as well as pre-ictal time intervals. For pre-ictal time intervals, the electrodes corresponding to the seizure-onset-zone were separately analyzed. The estimated ECDFs were different between patients and between different types of blocks. For all the analyzed patients, the estimated memory orders were on the order of tens of milliseconds (up to 100 ms). Significance: The proposed method facilitates the estimation of the causal associations between ECoG recordings, as these associations strongly depend on the recordings' memory. An improved estimation of causal associations can improve the performance of algorithms that use ECoG recordings to localize the epileptogenic zone. Such algorithms can aid doctors in their pre-surgical planning for the surgery of patients with epilepsy.},

The platform embodies the core attributes of the VersaSens concept: versatility, flexibility, and extendability across multiple aspects of hardware, software, and processing components. It features a modular design, consisting of sensor, processor, and co-processor modules, allowing for various configurations. To evaluate the efficiency of the platform, we tested three use cases: cough monitoring, heartbeat classification and epileptic seizure detection. In all cases, the results indicate that the platform effectively executes the applications, achieving low energy consumption. In particular, our findings indicates that the integration of a domain-specific edge-AI co-processor [i.e., HEEP ocrates (Machetti et al., 2024)] equipped with several hardware accelerators further improved the overall execution time and energy consumption of the system. These results demonstrate the potential of VersaSens to effectively support a diverse range of edge-AI applications and configurations, thereby providing a robust foundation for the research and development of novel smart wearable sensor systems.},

Methods:               EEG and ECG data for 21 patients with definite (n = 6) or probable (n = 15) SUDEP were compared with data from a group of 43 patients with refractory partial epilepsy. ECG abnormalities and heart rate (HR) changes were correlated with clinical data.                                         Results:               Fourteen patients died in their sleep; two were awake. Ictal maximal HR (90 seizures from 16 of 21 patients) was significantly higher in SUDEP (mean, 149 beats/min, BPM) than in comparison patients (mean, 126 BPM; p {$<$} 0.001). Greater increases in HR were associated with seizures arising from sleep (78 BPM increase) than from wakefulness (47 BPM; p {$<$} 0.001) in SUDEP, as compared with the non‐SUDEP group (52 BPM in sleep, 43 BPM in wakefulness; p = 0.27). Ictal cardiac repolarization and rhythm abnormalities occurred in 56\% of SUDEP (including two atrial fibrillation, two ventricular premature depolarizations, two marked sinus arrhythmia, two atrial premature depolarizations, one junctional escape, one ST‐segment elevation), and 39\% of comparison patients (p = 0.39). No specific seizure onset (laterality or lobe) was associated with SUDEP.                                         Conclusions:               This study reveals, for the first time, evidence of increased autonomic stimulation (as measured by HR) associated with seizures, particularly in sleep, in patients with SUDEP, as compared with a clinically similar group of patients with refractory epilepsy.},

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major cause of excess mortality in people with refractory epilepsy, and cardiac arrhythmias during seizures may be responsible. The frequency of cardiac abnormalities during seizures in patients with refractory epilepsy must be determined.                                         Methods               : Fifty‐one seizures in 43 patients with intractable partial epilepsy were analyzed prospectively from CCTV‐EEG monitoring with one ECG channel. Arrhythmias, repolarization abnormalities, and PR and QT               C               intervals were determined for preictal (3 min), ictal, and postictal (3 min) periods for one or more seizures per patient. Parametric statistics were used for continuous variables, and nonparametric statistics were used for categoric variables.                                         Results               : Of the patients, 39\% had one or more abnormalities of rhythm and/or repolarization during or immediately after seizures. Abnormalities included asystole (one), atrial fibrillation (one), marked or moderate sinus arrhythmia (six), supraventricular tachycardia (one), atrial premature depolarizations (APDs; eight), ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs; two), and bundle‐branch block (three). Mean seizure duration was longer in patients with abnormalities than in those without (204 vs. 71 s; p {$<$} 0.001). Generalized tonic–clonic seizures were also associated with increased occurrence of ictal ECG abnormalities (p = 0.006) as compared with complex partial seizures. There were no clinically significant differences in mean preictal and ictal/postictal PR and QT               C               intervals.

Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the regulation of cardiac activity and autonomic nervous system tone. The early detection of epileptic seizures could foster the use of new treatment approaches. This study presents a new methodology for the prediction of epileptic seizures using HRV signals. Eigendecomposition of HRV parameter covariance matrices was used to create an input for a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier. We analyzed clinical data from 12 patients (9 female; 3 male; age 34.5 ± 7.5 years), involving 34 seizures and a total of 55.2 h of interictal electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Data from 123.6 h of ECG recordings from healthy subjects were used to test false positive rate per hour (FP/h) in a completely independent data set. Our methodological approach allowed the detection of impending seizures from 5 min to just before the onset of a clinical/electrical seizure with a sensitivity of 94.1\%. The FP rate was 0.49 h−1 in the recordings from patients with epilepsy and 0.19 h−1 in the recordings from healthy subjects. Our results suggest that it is feasible to use the dynamics of HRV parameters for the early detection and, potentially, the prediction of epileptic seizures.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy, a complex pathology with various etiological origins, is characterized by producing hyperexcitability in the brain, which can have multiple disruptive symptoms. It impacts about 40 million people worldwide, of which 20 to 30\% have chronic and intractable seizures. Each seizure can create hazardous situations for patients resulting from fractures, burns, submersion accidents, and soft-tissue injuries. Therefore, a method capable of predicting a seizure with sufficient window time before its onset is highly desirable because it will allow the patient to locate a safe place or take appropriate precautionary actions. In this article, a novel method is presented through adroit integration of maximal overlap wavelet packet transform, homogeneity index, and a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to predict an epileptic event twenty minutes before its onset using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The method's effectiveness for predicting an epileptic seizure is verified by employing a database provided by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH), which includes seven patients with ten epileptic seizures. The results show that the proposed method effectively predicts an epileptic seizure 20~min prior to its onset with an accuracy of 93.25\%.},

  abstract = {Non-electroencephalogram seizure detection holds promise for the early identification of generalised onset seizures. However, existing methods often suffer from high false alarm rates and difficulty distinguishing normal movements from seizure manifestations. To address this, we obtained exclusive access to the Open Seizure Database and selected a representative dataset of 94 events (42 generalised tonic-clonic seizures, 19 focal seizures, and 33 labelled as Other), totaling approximately 5 hours and 29 minutes. Each event contains acceleration and heart rate data, which were expertly annotated by a clinician in 5 second timesteps, with each timestep assigned a class label of Normal, Pre-Ictal, or Ictal. We introduce AMBER (Attention-guided Multi-Branching pipeline with Enhanced Residual Fusion), a multimodal seizure detection model designed for Ictal-Phase Detection. AMBER constructs multiple branches to form independent feature extraction pipelines for each sensing modality. The outputs of each branch are passed to a Residual Fusion layer, where the extracted features are combined into a fused representation and propagated through two densely connected blocks. The results of these experiments highlight the effectiveness of Ictal Phase Detection, with the model recording an accuracy and f1-score of 0.9027 and 0.9035, respectively, on unseen test data. Further experiments recorded True Positive Rate of 0.8342, 0.9485, and 0.9118 for the Normal, Pre-Ictal, and Ictal phases, respectively, with an average False Positive Rate of 0.0502.

  abstract = {In this article, a new fusion scheme based on the Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory (DSET) is introduced for Epileptic Seizure Detection (ESD) in brain disorders. Firstly, various features in temporal, spectral, and temporal-spectral domains are extracted from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Afterward, a Correlation analysis via the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is conducted on the extracted features to select and remove highly correlated features. It leads to the second feature set with about half numbers of the first feature set. Next, three separate filter-type feature selection techniques, including Relief-F (RF), Compensation Distance Evaluation Technique (CDET), and Fisher Score (FS), are conducted to this second feature set for ranking features. Following that, a feature fusion is engaged by the DSET through the individual feature ranking results to generate high qualified feature sets. Indeed, the DSET-based feature fusion is devoted to enhancing the feature selection confidence using the least superb ranked features. In the classification stage, an Ensemble Decision Tree (EDT) classifier, along with two common validation procedures, including hold out and 10-fold cross-validation, is appropriated to classify the selected features from the EEG signals as normal, pre-ictal (epileptic background), and ictal (epileptic seizure) classes. Finally, several test scenarios are investigated using experimental data of Bonn University to evaluate the proposed ESD performance. Moreover, a comparison with other research works on the same dataset and classes is accomplished. The obtained results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed feature fusion approach and superior accuracy compared to the traditional methods.},

  abstract = {A reliable seizure detection or prediction device can potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with epileptic seizures. Previous findings indicating alterations in cardiac activity during seizures suggest the usefulness of cardiac parameters for seizure detection or prediction. This study aims to examine available studies on seizure detection and prediction based on cardiac parameters using non‐invasive wearable devices. The Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to systematically search according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis guidelines. Human studies that evaluated seizure detection or prediction based on cardiac parameters collected using wearable devices were included. The QUADAS‐2 tool and proposed standards for validation for seizure detection devices were used for quality assessment. Twenty‐four articles were identified and included in the analysis. Twenty studies evaluated seizure detection algorithms, and four studies focused on seizure prediction. Most studies used either a wrist‐worn or chest‐worn device for data acquisition. Among the seizure detection studies, cardiac parameters utilized for the algorithms mainly included heart rate (HR) (n\,=\,11) or a combination of HR and heart rate variability (HRV) (n\,=\,6). HR‐based seizure detection studies collectively reported a sensitivity range of 56\%‐100\% and a false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.02‐8/h, with most studies performing retrospective validation of the algorithms. Three of the seizure prediction studies retrospectively validated multimodal algorithms, combining cardiac features with other physiological signals. Only one study prospectively validated their seizure prediction algorithm using HRV extracted from ECG data collected from a custom wearable device. These studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using cardiac parameters for seizure detection and prediction with wearable devices, with varying algorithmic performance. Many studies are in the proof‐of‐principle stage, and evidence for real‐time detection or prediction is currently limited. Future studies should prioritize further refinement of the algorithm performance with prospective validation using large‐scale longitudinal data.},

Seizure detection devices could be invaluable tools for both people with epilepsy, their caregivers, and clinicians as they could alert caretakers about seizures, reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, and provide objective and more reliable seizure tracking to guide treatment decisions or monitor outcomes in clinical trials. Objective To synthesize the characteristics of commercial seizure detection tools/devices currently available. Methods We performed a systematic search utilizing a diverse set of resources to identify commercially available seizure detection products for consumer use. Performance data was obtained through a systematic review on commercially available products. Observations We identified 23 products marketed for seizure detection/alerting. Devices utilize a variety of mechanisms to detect seizures, including movement detectors, autonomic change detectors, electroencephalogram (EEG) based detectors, and other mechanisms (audio). The optimal device for a person with epilepsy depends on a variety of factors including the main purpose of the device, their age, seizure type and personal preferences. Only 8 devices have published peer-reviewed performance data and the majority for tonic-clonic seizures. An informed conversation between the clinician and the patient can help guide if a seizure detection device is appropriate. Conclusions and relevance Seizure detection devices have a potential to reduce morbidity and mortality for certain people with epilepsy. Clinicians should be familiar with the characteristics of commercially available devices to best counsel their patients on whether a seizure detection device may be beneficial and what the optimal devices may be.},

  abstract = {Continuous overnight vital signs monitoring would be ideal for patients suffering from epilepsy, where life-threatening hypoxemias can occur during sleep. However, the existing physiological monitoring systems suffer from limitations in terms of usability factors and/or limited information of the signals being acquired. The body location of the monitoring system is a crucial consideration, seldom addressed by the wider community. This article presents a proof-of-concept, neck-worn photoplethysmography system, which was developed and tested to assess the feasibility of the neck as a monitoring site for longitudinal sensing of cardiac and respiratory responses during sleep. The novel system was compared against a gold-standard commercial multichannel cardiorespiratory polysomnography (PSG) system during oxygen desaturation cycles, to assess its ability to measure heart rate, respiratory rate (RR), and peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) on 15 participants. The findings for heart rate showed a marginal mean error of 0.47 beats/min with limits of agreement (LOA) at 95\% confidence between −3.17 and 4 bpm. RR comparisons had an overall mean error of 0.43 breaths/min, with LOA at 95\% confidence between −2.73 and 3.3 bpm. Lastly, the system accurately outputs SpO2 with an overall root-mean-square error of 1.44\% between 90 and 100\% SpO2 using a custom calibration method. Moreover, it was observed that the neck made it possible for the system to detect desaturation events on an average 12.6 s prior to the PSG system, which used a peripheral finger-based PPG system. Ultimately, this proof-of-concept study illustrates the viability of neck-based sensing for minimally invasive monitoring of cardiac and respiratory vitals during sleep.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the preferences and user experiences of people with epilepsy and caregivers regarding automated wearable seizure detection devices. METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review. We searched electronic databases for original peer-reviewed publications between January 1, 2000, and May 26, 2021. Key search terms included "epilepsy," "seizure," "wearable," and "non-invasive." We performed a descriptive and qualitative thematic analysis of the studies included according to the technology acceptance model. Full texts of the discussion sections were further analyzed to identify word frequency and word mapping. RESULTS: Twenty-two observational studies were identified. Collectively, they comprised responses from 3,299 participants including patients with epilepsy, caregivers, and healthcare workers. Sixteen studies examined user preferences, 5 examined user experiences, and 1 examined both experiences and preferences. Important preferences for wearables included improving care, cost, accuracy, and design. Patients desired real-time detection with a latency of ≤15 minutes from seizure occurrence, along with high sensitivity (≥90\%) and low false alarm rates. Device-related costs were a major factor for device acceptance, where device costs of \&lt;\$300 USD and a monthly subscription fee of \&lt;\$20 USD were preferred. Despite being a major driver of wearable-based technologies, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy was rarely discussed. Among studies evaluating user experiences, there was a greater acceptance toward wristwatches. Thematic coding analysis showed that attitudes toward device use and perceived usefulness were reported consistently. Word mapping identified "specificity," "cost," and "battery" as key single terms and "battery life," "insurance coverage," "prediction/detection quality," and the effect of devices on "daily life" as key bigrams. DISCUSSION: User acceptance of wearable technology for seizure detection was strongly influenced by accuracy, design, comfort, and cost. Our findings emphasize the need for standardized and validated tools to comprehensively examine preferences and user experiences of wearable devices in this population using the themes identified in this study. Greater efforts to incorporate perspectives and user experiences in developing wearables for seizure detection, particularly in community-based settings, are needed.

Neonatal seizures (NS) that frequently occur in the immature brain may influence autonomic maturation and lead to detectable cardiovascular signs. These autonomic manifestations can also have significant diagnostic and prognostic value. The analysis of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) represents the most used and feasible method to evaluate cardiac autonomic regulation. This narrative review summarizes studies investigating HRV dynamics in newborns with seizures, with the aim of highlighting the potential utility of HRV measures for seizure detection and management. While HRV analysis in critically ill newborns is influenced by many potential confounders, we suggest that it can enhance the ability to better diagnose seizures in the clinical setting. We present potential applications of the analysis of HRV, which could have a useful future role, beyond the research setting.},

  abstract = {Forecasting the spatial and temporal distribution of aftershocks is of great importance to earthquake scientists, civil protection authorities and the general public as these events cause disproportionate damage and consternation relative to their size. At present, there are two main approaches to such forecasts—purely statistical methods based on observations of the initial portions of aftershock sequences and a physics-based approach based on Coulomb stress changes caused by the main shock. Here we develop a new method which combines the spatial constraints from the Coulomb model with the statistical power of the STEP (short-term earthquake probability) approach. We test this pseudo prospectively and retrospectively on the Canterbury sequence against the STEP model and a Coulomb rate–state method, using data from the first 10 d following each main event to forecast the rate of M ≥ 4 events in the following 100 d. We find that in retrospective tests the new model outperforms STEP for two events in the sequence but this is not the case for pseudo-prospective tests. Further, the Coulomb rate–state approach never performs better than STEP. Our results suggest that incorporating the physical constraints from Coulomb stress changes can increase the forecasting power of statistical models and clearly show the importance of good data quality if prospective forecasts are to be implemented in practice.},

  abstract = {Epileptic networks are intimately connected with the autonomic nervous system, as exemplified by a plethora of ictal (during a seizure) autonomic manifestations, including epigastric sensations, palpitations, goosebumps and syncope (fainting). Ictal autonomic changes might serve as diagnostic clues, provide targets for seizure detection and help us to understand the mechanisms that underlie sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Autonomic alterations are generally more prominent in focal seizures originating from the temporal lobe, demonstrating the importance of limbic structures to the autonomic nervous system, and are particularly pronounced in focal-to-bilateral and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The presence, type and severity of autonomic features are determined by the seizure onset zone, propagation pathways, lateralization and timing of the seizures, and the presence of interictal autonomic dysfunction. Evidence is mounting that not all autonomic manifestations are linked to SUDEP. In addition, experimental and clinical data emphasize the heterogeneity of SUDEP and its infrequent overlap with sudden cardiac death. Here, we review the spectrum and diagnostic value of the mostly benign and self-limiting autonomic manifestations of epilepsy. In particular, we focus on presentations that are likely to contribute to SUDEP and discuss how wearable devices might help to prevent SUDEP.},

  abstract = {Wearable devices for health monitoring are essential for tracking individuals’ health status and facilitating early detection of diseases. However, processing biomedical signals online for real-time monitoring is challenging due to limited computational resources on edge devices. To address this challenge, we propose an application-agnostic methodology called ACE (Automated optimization towards classification on the Edge). ACE converts a health monitoring algorithm with feature extraction and classification into an iterative detection process, incorporating algorithms of varying complexities and minimizing re-computation of shared data. First, ACE decomposes a monolithic model, employing a single feature set and classifier, into multiple algorithms with different computational complexities. Then, our automatic analysis tool integrates buffering logic into these algorithms to prevent re-computation of shared computational-intensive data. The optimized algorithm is then converted into a low-level language in C for deployment. During runtime, the system initiates monitoring with the lowest complexity algorithm and iteratively involves algorithms with higher complexity without recomputing the existing data. The iteration process continues until a pre-defined confidence threshold is met. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACE on two biomedical applications: seizure detection and emotional state classification. ACE achieves at least 28.9\% and 18.9\% runtime savings without any accuracy loss on a Cortex-A9 edge platform for the two benchmarks, respectively. We discuss and demonstrate how ACE can be used by designers of such biomedical algorithms to automatically optimize and deploy their applications on the edge.},

  abstract = {Wearable wristband device-based epilepsy detection has the merits of noninvasiveness, portability, low costs, and good environmental adaptability. However, attention has been paid to exploring the attitude angle signals collected by wearable devices for epilepsy detection. In this article, a systematic analysis of whether the wearable device-based attitude angle signals, particularly the PITCH and ROLL angles, can be applied to epilepsy seizure detection, is studied. The relationship among attitude angle signals, acceleration, and angular velocity signals at the feature level is analyzed, and the detection effectiveness of combining different attitude angle features for classifier training and testing is presented and discussed. The long-term recorded data were collected by wearable devices from 28 epileptic patients, of which 11 were from the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and 17 from the Department of Neurology, Children’s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Each recording includes the measurement of three-axis acceleration (ACC), three-axis gyroscope (GYR), ROLL, PITCH, surface electromyography (SEMG), and electrodermal activity (EDA), with at least one seizure recorded for each subject. Experimental results show that ROLL and PITCH angles can be utilized for epilepsy detection, with better performance than using ACC and GYR. Moreover, the attitude angle feature training by a long short-term memory (LSTM) network can achieve the highest accuracy and efficiency.},

However, the reliability of diagnoses provided by these non-approved medical devices remains uncertain. This study addresses the problem of assessing the measurement accuracy of heart rate recordings from wearable devices in both controlled and uncontrolled environments. Previous research has focused on evaluating accuracy in controlled settings, neglecting the impact of external factors on device performance. We conducted a comparative study with ten healthy individuals, recording heart rates during indoor cycling and outdoor activities. Participants wore two out of three tested smartwatches (Apple Watch Ultra, Garmin Enduro 2, Polar Pacer Pro) alongside a Polar H10 chest strap as a reference device. Our findings provide evidence that the Apple Watch Ultra and the Garmin Enduro 2 are particularly resistant to external factors that can occur during regular cycling activities.},

However, the format and structure of publicly available datasets are different from each other, and there is a lack of guidelines on the use of these datasets. This impacts the generatability, generalizability, and reproducibility of the results and findings produced by the studies. In this narrative review, we compiled and compared the different characteristics of the publicly available EEG datasets that are commonly used to develop seizure detection and prediction algorithms. We investigated the advantages and limitations of the characteristics of the EEG datasets. Based on our study, we identified 17 characteristics that make the EEG datasets unique from each other. We also briefly looked into how certain characteristics of the publicly available datasets affect the performance and outcome of a study, as well as the influences it has on the choice of ML techniques and preprocessing steps required to develop seizure detection and prediction algorithms. In conclusion, this study provides a guideline on the choice of publicly available EEG datasets to both clinicians and scientists working to develop a reproducible, generalizable, and effective seizure detection and prediction algorithm.},

  abstract = {Seizure detection is traditionally done using video/electroencephalography monitoring, but for out-of-hospital patients, this method is costly. In recent years, portable device to detect seizures gains attention. In this article, multimodal signals collected by portable devices are studied, and a seizure detection algorithm is proposed based on adaptive multibit local differential ternary pattern (MLDTP). This algorithm is used for detecting seizure period and interseizure period. Traditional local binary pattern has certain limitations in describing 1-D time-series signals. It can only describe two types of structures in signals: 1) rising structure and 2) falling structure, making the signal patterns overly monotonous and not conducive to classification tasks. To address this issue, this article introduces two additional structures, slowly rising structure and slowly falling structure, into the signal description using the MLDTP method. This method constructs multibit neighboring relationships of the signals and adaptively selects the optimal MLDTP parameters for different modalities using the Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA). Additionally, this article extensively discusses a multimodal signal fusion strategy, mapping features of different modal signals to the same feature space through the MLDTP algorithm to achieve information complementarity. Long-term recorded data from 18 patients were collected using the wearable device Biovital P1, with 13 cases from the Children’s Hospital affiliated with Children’s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and five cases from the fourth Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. The data set underwent fivefold cross-validation, resulting in average accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1 score of 96.81\%, 98.55\%, 95.24\%, and 96.87\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and health sensory data-fusion hold the potential to automate many laborious and time-consuming processes in hospitals or ambulatory settings, e.g. home monitoring and telehealth. One such unmet challenge is rapid and accurate epileptic seizure annotation. An accurate and automatic approach can provide an alternative way to label seizures in epilepsy or deliver a substitute for inaccurate patient self-reports. Multimodal sensory fusion is believed to provide an avenue to improve the performance of AI systems in seizure identification. We propose a state-of-the-art performing AI system that combines electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) for seizure identification, tested on clinical data with early evidence demonstrating generalization across hospitals. The model was trained and validated on the publicly available Temple University Hospital (TUH) dataset. To evaluate performance in a clinical setting, we conducted non-patient-specific pseudo-prospective inference tests on three out-of-distribution datasets, including EPILEPSIAE (30 patients) and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) in Sydney, Australia (31 neurologists-shortlisted patients and 30 randomly selected). Our multimodal approach improves the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) by an average margin of 6.71\% and 14.42\% for deep learning techniques using EEG-only and ECG-only, respectively. Our model’s state-of-the-art performance and robustness to out-of-distribution datasets show the accuracy and efficiency necessary to improve epilepsy diagnoses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pseudo-prospective study of an AI system combining EEG and ECG modalities for automatic seizure annotation achieved with fusion of two deep learning networks.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures. Although an increasingly intense research effort has focused on the use of brain signal data to predict or detect epileptic seizures as early as possible, this problem is still computationally challenging. The main challenge is that the patient's brain signal has strong individual characteristics, and the classification model is easily disturbed by this, which may lead to false predictions, affecting the reliability of the model. Based on the development of brain signal acquisition technology and deep learning, we propose a new type of deep learning model called the Epilepsy Domain Adversarial Neural Network (EDANN) model, which is used to classify epileptic pre-ictal signals. EDANN integrates multiple deep neural networks based on the idea of adversarial learning, which can reduce the impact of the differences between patients on model prediction. The multi-network design in EDANN effectively improves the model training stability and model generalizability. In addition, a unique brain signal processing algorithm is developed to convert signals to data blocks that are ready for pre-ictal classification, and the model may provide an auxiliary diagnosis for early warning of epilepsy. Experimental results on real patient data show that EDANN clearly improved the F1 score by approximately 7.2\% compared with the existing models. On a real dataset, our model achieved state-of-the-art results.},

In light of the high prevalence and substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), this systematic review examines the cost and cost-effectiveness of using RPM to manage CVD in the United States. Methods We systematically searched databases to identify potentially relevant research. Findings were synthesized for cost and cost-effectiveness by economic study type with consideration of study perspective, intervention, clinical outcome, and time horizon. The methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Economic Evaluations. Results Thirteen articles with fourteen studies published between 2011 and 2021 were included in the final review. Studies from the provider perspective with a narrow scope of cost components identified higher costs and similar effectiveness for the RPM group relative to the usual care group. However, studies from payer and healthcare sector perspectives indicate better clinical effectiveness of RPM relative to usual care, with two cost-utility analysis studies suggesting that RPM relative to usual care is a cost-effective tool for CVD management even at the conservative \$50,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year threshold. Additionally, all model-based studies revealed that RPM is cost-effective in the long run. Conclusions Full economic evaluations identified RPM as a potentially cost-effective tool, particularly for long-term CVD management. In addition to the current literature, rigorous economic analysis with a broader perspective is needed in evaluating the value and economic sustainability of RPM.},

  abstract = {The detection of Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizures (GTCS) and Falls is of utmost importance due to the increase in prevalence of epilepsy and Sudden Death in Epileptic Patients during CoVID-19 pandemic, and prevention of serious injuries in Fall risk groups such as elderly requiring continuous monitoring for disease management and assisted living etc. Monitoring of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) can assist in the detection of symptoms and onset of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s, stroke, and epileptic seizures. With a host of embedded sensors, improved memory, enhanced processing capabilities and availability to masses, smartphones can be used for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) through continuous monitoring of ADLs. This paper presents a tri-axial accelerometer-based approach to detect and classify activities performed by individuals by applying machine learning algorithms including RF, J48, NB, LMT and SVM to movement data. Movement data is collected in real-time from the embedded accelerometer of a smartphone worn by individual on upper-left arm in unconstraint environment. It is pre-processed using time and frequency domain analysis and spatial domain features are computed. Supervised machine learning techniques are applied to classify ADLs into five classes based on the intensity of movements: Stationary, Light Ambulatory, Intense Ambulatory, GTCS and Falls. We also used training data from MyNeuroHealth dataset collected from 23 individuals including epilepsy patients. Based on gathered results, Random Forest outperforms other classifiers with classification accuracy of 99.6\% for stationary, 81.5\% for light ambulatory, 99.8\% for intense ambulatory and GTCS, and 97.2\% for Falls corresponding to training data of 14000 samples. To date, activity classification in our system has been implemented on cloud instead of mobile phone application as subjects are using smartphones with dissimilar software and hardware specifications for assisted living applications.},

To assess the risk factors for the occurrence of ECG abnormalities.                                         Methods:               We analyzed retrospectively 281 seizures in 81 patients with intractable epilepsy who had prolonged video‐EEG and two‐channel ECG. The nature and timing of heart rate changes compared to the electrographic and clinical seizure onset was determined. The ictal period (including one minute preictally and three minutes postictally) was analyzed for cardiac arrhythmias, conduction and repolarization abnormalities. Risk factors for cardiac abnormalities were investigated using parametric and non‐parametric statistics.                                         Results:               There was an increase in heart rate of at least 10 beats/minute in 73\% of seizures (93\% of patients) and this occurred most often around seizure onset. In 23\% of seizures (49\% of patients) the rate increase preceded both the electrographic and the clinical onset. ECG abnormalities were found in 26\% of seizures (44\% of patients). One patient had an asystole for 30 seconds. Long seizure duration increased the occurrence of ECG abnormalities. No other risk factor was found.                                         Conclusions:               Heart rate changes occur frequently and occur around the time or even before the earliest electrographic or clinical change. The change can clarify the timing of seizure onset and the specific rate pattern may be useful for seizure diagnosis and for automatic seizure detection. ECG abnormalities occur often and repeatedly in several seizures of the same patient.},
