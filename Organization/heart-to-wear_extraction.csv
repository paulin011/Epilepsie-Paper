Data preparation,Resampling formula,"Xt = (1/s) * sum_{i=0}^{s-1} X_{t-i}, where s is seconds since last Apple Watch sample and X_{t-i} is Polar H10 at t-i"
Data preparation,Sampling interval,"Apple Watch: ~5s between HR samples; Garmin & Polar: 1Hz (per second)"
Evaluation,Primary metric,"Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) vs Polar H10"
Evaluation,Secondary analysis,"Bland-Altman plots: mean difference and 95% limits of agreement"
Evaluation,CCC interpretation,"McBride 2005: >0.99 almost perfect; 0.95-0.99 substantial; 0.90-0.95 moderate; <0.90 poor"
Results,Apple Watch Ultra overall CCC,"0.998 (almost perfect, indoors & outdoors, both wrists)"
Results,Garmin Enduro 2 overall CCC,"0.995 (almost perfect but more dispersion than Apple)"
Results,Polar Pacer Pro overall CCC,"0.957 (substantial; worse on dominant wrist, especially indoors)"
Results,Dominant vs non-dominant,"All watches slightly worse on dominant wrist; Polar can be poor on dominant indoors"
Results,Low-HR deviations Polar,"Deviations up to ~70 bpm in 90–120 bpm range; strong deviations in first minute"
Results,Outdoor artifacts,"Road bumps and hand signals did not significantly degrade Apple/Garmin accuracy"
Conclusion,Main finding,"Apple Watch Ultra and Garmin Enduro 2 are accurate & robust in real-world cycling; Polar Pacer Pro acceptable but less reliable"
Conclusion,Clinical trade-off,"Apple/Garmin higher cost vs Polar lower cost but lower accuracy"
Limitations,Sample size,"N=10 healthy, right-handed, summer conditions → limited generalizability"
Limitations,Activity types,"Only cycling (indoor/outdoor), no other everyday activities"
Future work,External factors,"Study broader external factors (temperature, hydration, fitness, emotional state, motion artifacts) quantitatively"
