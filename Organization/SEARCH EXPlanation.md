Used google scholar and ieee xplore

google scholar for specific papers for outline and initial research as well as planning

ieee xplore(all queries) pubmend(some) and Scopus for more specific papers and references to back up claims made in the outline and initial research using search terms only from 2015-2025 and only journals:

- "seizure prediction" AND (ECG OR electrocardiogram OR heart rate variability OR HRV OR cardiac) NOT EEG
- "seizure detection" AND (ECG OR PPG OR wearable OR photoplethysmography OR heart rate variability) NOT EEG
- "wearable" AND ("seizure" OR "epilepsy") AND (ECG OR PPG OR EDA OR accelerometer) NOT EEG
- "pre-ictal" OR "preictal" AND (ECG OR HRV OR heart rate) NOT EEG
- "pseudo-prospective" OR "prospective" AND (seizure prediction OR seizure detection) AND (ECG OR wearable)

## Methodology (selection and screening)
- Scope: human studies; journals; 2015–2025; non‑EEG wearable/autonomic biosignals (ECG/HRV, PPG, EDA, ACC); seizure detection or prediction.
- Databases: Google Scholar (scoping), IEEE Xplore (all queries), PubMed and Scopus (targeted).
- Process: deduplicate results; title/abstract screen; full‑text eligibility against scope; backward/forward citation chasing on key papers.
- Extraction (per paper): modality, dataset type (wearable vs clinical), task (detection vs prediction), evaluation design (retrospective/pseudo‑prospective/prospective), metrics (sensitivity, FAR/h, AUC), personalization, data availability.
- Quality flags: sample‑ vs alarm‑based evaluation, patient‑preserving splits, external validation/cross‑dataset tests.
- Documentation: save BibTeX to `Epilepsie.bib`; record query strings and search dates with database used.
