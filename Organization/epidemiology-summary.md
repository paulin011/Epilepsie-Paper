# Summary — The Epidemiology of Epilepsy (Beghi, 2020)

Reference
- Beghi E. The Epidemiology of Epilepsy. Neuroepidemiology 2020;54:185–191. DOI: 10.1159/000503831
- Type: Narrative review (global epidemiologic data synthesis)

Scope and purpose
- Provide an overview of definitions, incidence, prevalence, prognosis, mortality, burden and temporal trends of epilepsy worldwide.

Key definitions
- Epilepsy: per ILAE — (1) ≥2 unprovoked seizures >24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked seizure + ≥60% 10-year recurrence risk; or (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. For population studies, epilepsy is commonly defined as ≥2 unprovoked seizures.
- Acute symptomatic (provoked) seizure: seizure occurring in temporal proximity to an acute CNS insult.
- Active epilepsy: treated with antiepileptic medication or seizure within last 5 years.
- SUDEP: sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (usually seizure‑triggered, nontraumatic, non‑drowning, no postmortem cause).

Epidemiologic estimates (selected figures from the review)
- Incidence (pooled): ~61.4 per 100,000 person‑years (95% CI 50.7–74.4).
  - Higher in LMIC: 139.0 (95% CI 69.4–278.2) vs HIC: 48.9 (95% CI 39.0–61.1).
- Lifetime prevalence (pooled): 7.60 per 1,000 population (95% CI 6.17–9.38).
  - Higher in LMIC: 8.75 per 1,000 vs HIC: 5.18 per 1,000.
- Point prevalence of active epilepsy: 6.38 per 1,000 (95% CI 5.57–7.30).
- Age patterns:
  - Peak incidence in first year of life (~86 per 100,000), trough in adulthood (≈23–31 per 100,000 at ages 30–59), increase in elderly (up to ~180 per 100,000 in >85 years).
  - Focal seizures predominate in children and adults; generalized tonic‑clonic seizures more often reported in some LMICs (likely ascertainment bias).
- Prognosis and remission:
  - 55–68% of newly diagnosed cases achieve prolonged remission in several studies.
  - After a first unprovoked seizure: recurrence risk ~36–37% at 1 year, ~43–45% at 2 years; pooled average recurrence risk ~51%.
  - Long-term outcomes vary: early/late remission, relapsing‑remitting, or worsening courses observed.
- SUDEP incidence: ~1.2 per 1,000 person‑years (95% CI 0.9–1.5).
  - Higher risk associated with generalized tonic‑clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, drug‑refractory epilepsy.
- Mortality and burden:
  - Standardized mortality ratio in HIC: ~1.6–3.0; in LMIC much higher (reported pooled estimate ~19.8, wide CI).
  - Global burden (2016): ~46 million people with epilepsy; >13 million DALYs attributable to epilepsy.

Determinants and heterogeneity
- Incidence and prevalence differ by region due to demographic structure, perinatal care, CNS infection/TBI rates, and access to care.
- Etiology is identified in ≈50% of cases in many HIC studies; the rest remain cryptogenic/unknown.
- Socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and healthcare access influence observed rates and outcomes.

Temporal trends and drivers
- Declining incidence in youngest age groups over recent decades (better perinatal care, infection control).
- Increasing incidence in elderly (aging populations, stroke, neurodegenerative disease).
- Overall age‑standardized mortality and DALY rates have decreased (1990–2016), likely due to improved care and survival.

Limitations highlighted in the review
- Heterogeneous study designs, case definitions, and ascertainment methods across studies hinder direct comparisons.
- Underreporting and treatment gaps in LMIC affect prevalence/incidence estimates.
- Need for standardized, population‑based, representative data with clear case verification.

Conclusions & implications
- Epilepsy remains a common, globally distributed neurological disorder with substantial burden, especially in LMIC.
- Improving access to diagnosis and treatment in LMIC could substantially reduce burden.
- Future epidemiologic work should standardize definitions and methods and collect representative data on causes, severity, and treatment.

Notes for your review
- Use these figures when writing background and burden sections.
- Link the demographic/etiologic variation to generalizability concerns for seizure‑prediction studies (e.g., heterogeneity in patient populations and seizure types).
- Cite Beghi (2020) for standard definitions (ILAE) and global epidemiologic benchmarks.
