# Organization Folder

This folder collects structured notes and extraction tables (CSV) for your literature.

Current files:

- `heart-to-wear_extraction.csv` – compact CSV with key structured info from **Heart-to-Wear** (data handling, evaluation, main results, limitations, future work).
- `heart-to-wear_notes.md` – more detailed, human-readable organization notes and context for **Heart-to-Wear**, useful when writing your thesis.

You can open the CSV in Excel, LibreOffice Calc, or Python/R for further analysis.
