Key findings on treatment success

- Cohort: 525 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy (median follow-up 5 years).
- Overall seizure remission: 63% were seizure-free at last clinic visit.
- Previously untreated subgroup (n = 470): 64% became seizure-free during treatment.
  - 47% were controlled by the first antiepileptic drug.
  - 14% became seizure-free on a second or third drug.
  - 3% required two drugs to achieve control.
- Monotherapy effectiveness:
  - 81% of patients were on a single antiepileptic drug at last visit.
  - Seizure-free rates were similar for established drugs (67%) and newer drugs (69%) — no significant efficacy difference reported.
- Polytherapy performed poorly:
  - Only 23% of patients on two drugs were seizure-free; 0% of patients on three drugs were seizure-free (in this cohort).

Predictors related to treatment success

- Etiology: Patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsy had worse outcomes than those with idiopathic epilepsy (40% vs. 26% continued to have seizures).
- Pretreatment seizure burden: Patients with >20 seizures before starting therapy had substantially worse control (51% uncontrolled) than those with ≤20 seizures (29% uncontrolled).
- Early response is prognostic: an inadequate response to the first drug predicted poor long-term control.
  - If first drug failed due to lack of efficacy, only 11% later became seizure-free.
  - If first drug stopped for intolerable side effects, 41% later became seizure-free.
  - If stopped for an idiosyncratic reaction (e.g., rash, hepatotoxicity), 55% later became seizure-free.

Side effects and tolerability

- Reasons for discontinuing the first drug among previously untreated patients (n=470): lack of efficacy (113), intolerable side effects (69), idiosyncratic reactions (29), other reasons (37).
- Idiosyncratic reactions reported included rash and hepatotoxicity.
- Newer drugs did not show superior seizure-free rates but in randomized trials some (e.g., lamotrigine) had fewer side effects and lower dropout rates compared with carbamazepine.
- Among patients who discontinued therapy by choice (n=44), 77% had been seizure-free for >1 year.

Clinical implications (authors' conclusions)

- Monotherapy is an appropriate goal for most patients; many achieve seizure freedom on a single drug, and newer drugs are not clearly more effective than established agents.
- A poor response to the first antiepileptic drug or a high pretreatment seizure count identifies patients at higher risk for refractory epilepsy and may prompt earlier consideration of alternative strategies (rational combination therapy or referral for surgical evaluation when indicated).

Notes

- All percentages and counts are taken from the cohort and subgroup analyses reported in the paper. The study is observational from a single center (Western Infirmary, Glasgow) with follow-up median 5 years.
