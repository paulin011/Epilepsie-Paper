Autonomic manifestations of epilepsy: 
emerging pathways to sudden death?

Roland D. Thijs1,2,3 ✉, Philippe Ryvlin4 and Rainer Surges5

Abstract | Epileptic networks are intimately connected with the autonomic nervous system,  
as exemplified by a plethora of ictal (during a seizure) autonomic manifestations, including 
epigastric sensations, palpitations, goosebumps and syncope (fainting). Ictal autonomic changes 
might serve as diagnostic clues, provide targets for seizure detection and help us to understand 
the mechanisms that underlie sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Autonomic 
alterations are generally more prominent in focal seizures originating from the temporal lobe, 
demonstrating the importance of limbic structures to the autonomic nervous system, and are 
particularly pronounced in focal- to- bilateral and generalized tonic–clonic seizures. The presence, 
type and severity of autonomic features are determined by the seizure onset zone, propagation 
pathways, lateralization and timing of the seizures, and the presence of interictal autonomic 
dysfunction. Evidence is mounting that not all autonomic manifestations are linked to SUDEP.  
In addition, experimental and clinical data emphasize the heterogeneity of SUDEP and its 
infrequent overlap with sudden cardiac death. Here, we review the spectrum and diagnostic 
value of the mostly benign and self- limiting autonomic manifestations of epilepsy. In particular, 
we focus on presentations that are likely to contribute to SUDEP and discuss how wearable 
devices might help to prevent SUDEP.

The intimate connection between epileptic networks 
and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is illustrated 
by a plethora of ictal autonomic manifestations includ-
ing epigastric sensations, palpitations, goosebumps and 
syncope1,2. Early case descriptions in people with epi-
lepsy helped to uncover the hidden ties between the heart 
and the brain. As a prelude to the discovery of the so- 
called ‘central autonomic network’ (CAN), Russell noted 
over 100 years ago that seizures can not only increase 
but also decrease heart rate:3 “he uttered a cry and 
was seen to be rubbing his hands together. His pulse was 
immediately examined for but was not palpable.”

The paroxysmal disruptions of normal brain activity 
that are seen in epilepsy provide a unique model with 
which to explore the brain–heart axis. Since Russell’s 
observations, substantial progress has been made in this 
field: functional studies have unravelled the workings of 
the CAN, and autonomic concepts are beginning to be 
translated into clinical applications. Autonomic mani-
festations in people with epilepsy are also attracting 
interest, particularly in view of their potential to pre-
dict sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). 
Emerging experimental and clinical data have been 
instrumental in separating autonomic alterations that 
might contribute to death from benign self- limiting 
phenomena such as ictal syncope, and in delineating 

the various pathways that contribute to SUDEP. Another 
interesting prospect is the development of wearable tech-
nologies and algorithms that use autonomic alterations 
to detect and provide alerts to tonic–clonic seizures (TCSs) 
and other seizure types.

In this article, we review the many facets of seizure- 
related autonomic manifestations and their diagnostic 
value for delineating the seizure- onset zone, with a 
special focus on cardiovascular and respiratory mani-
festations, given their potential role in SUDEP. We 
summarize the key anatomical structures that regulate 
the CAN, critically review the spectrum of presentations 
that are likely to contribute to sudden death and discuss 
the potential of wearable devices to prevent SUDEP.

Ictal autonomic manifestations
Clinical presentations
Autonomic manifestations of seizures are extremely 
common and might represent the key clinical ictal 
manifestations in some patients. Non- motor- onset focal 
aware or impaired- awareness seizures can be classified 
as ‘autonomic’ if they cause gastrointestinal sensations, 
a sense of heat or cold, flushing, piloerection (goose-
bumps), palpitations, sexual arousal, respiratory changes 
and/or other autonomic symptoms4. Some sensations —  
in particular, a rising sensation or diffuse hot–cold

•	Autonomic manifestations of seizures are frequent; they are generally more 

prominent in focal seizures that originate from the temporal lobe and are particularly 
pronounced in focal- to- bilateral and generalized tonic–clonic seizures (TcSs).

•	Ictal autonomic changes might serve as diagnostic clues, provide targets for seizure 

detection and help us to understand the mechanisms that underlie sudden 
unexpected death in epilepsy (SuDeP).

•	Ictal asystole is the most frequent clinically relevant seizure- related arrhythmia.  
The key clinical expressions include flaccid falls with injuries and other signs of 
syncope (for example, intense pallor, jerks, stiffening and gasping) during the course 
of a temporal lobe seizure.

•	SuDeP contrasts with self- limiting autonomic features because it typically occurs  

in the aftermath of a TcS, whereas ictal apnoea and ictal asystole are associated with 
focal — mostly temporal lobe — seizures.

•	SuDeP has a spectrum of heterogeneous causes but is predominantly attributable  

to TcS- triggered postictal apnoea–asystole.

•	SuDeP and sudden cardiac death are partially overlapping entities, and the presence 
of pre- existing or acute cardiac comorbidities might help to differentiate between 
these two events.

sensations — can also be labelled as sensory if they 
occur in isolation but should be classified as autonomic 
if they are accompanied by other autonomic symptoms 
or signs5.

Ictal autonomic manifestations tend to be under- 
reported  because  they  might  not  be  recognized  as 
seizure- related, or might be too subtle or not remem-
bered. In a prospective survey, only 11% of documented 
autonomic expressions were recalled by the patient6. 
In a prospective video- electroencephalogram (EEG) 
study, all individuals with ictal central apnoea seemed 
to be unaware of their apnoea7. In 16% of these sei-
zures, apnoea was the sole clinical manifestation, which 
emphasizes the importance of polygraphic monitoring 
of respiration7.

Autonomic seizure manifestations can provide clues 
to the localization or lateralization of the ictal onset 
zone but should always be considered in the context of a 
complete diagnostic epilepsy evaluation (Table 1). Most 
autonomic seizures originate from the temporal lobe, 
highlighting the important role of the limbic system in 
the CAN. Each sign should be evaluated in the context 
of preceding autonomic manifestations. For example, 
asystole could be the first ictal expression, but could also 
follow ictal apnoea or ictal hypotension. Another impor-
tant aspect to consider is the seizure type and the timing 
of the event. For instance, ictal asystole (IA) is predom-
inantly seen in focal seizures of temporal lobe onset, 
whereas postictal asystole is strongly associated with 
TCSs, including both primary generalized TCSs and 
focal- to- bilateral TCSs8. The same holds true for apnoea: 
ictal central apnoea is strongly linked to focal temporal 
lobe seizures, whereas postictal central apnoea is seen 
only in the context of TCSs7,9.

Cardiovascular manifestations
Ictal tachycardia. Heart rate alterations are the most 
studied and probably the most frequent ictal autonomic 
signs10. Prevalence estimates of ictal tachycardia range 
from 38% to 100% owing to varying studied populations 
and definitions10. Most of these heart rate increases do

not, however, meet the most commonly applied defi-
nition for sinus tachycardia (heart rate >100 bpm)11. 
Similar heart rate increases can be seen during phys-
iological states such as exercise, nocturnal arousals 
or psychogenic non- epileptic seizures, although the 
abruptness and the accompanying changes in heart rate 
variability (HRV) might help to identify seizure- related 
tachycardia12,13.

The degree of autonomic change varies according 
to the seizure type. Ictal tachycardia seems to be more 
prominent in seizures originating from the temporal 
lobe than in seizures with extratemporal lobe onset14, 
and the most marked heart rate changes have been 
reported in TCSs15–17. Depth EEG recordings in people 
with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) indicate that ictal 
tachycardia coincides with seizure activity in the anterior 
hippocampus and amygdala18. The extent of the heart 
rate increase correlates with gradual seizure spread to 
subregions of the ipsilateral and contralateral temporal 
lobes19,20.

Heart rate changes might represent the earliest clin-
ical indicator of seizure onset and, thus, could be of 
interest for seizure detection21. In up to 36% of seizures, 
the heart rate was reported to increase before seizure 
onset could be detected on scalp EEG, with a median 
lag time of 11 s  (reF.14). However, scalp EEG cannot 
reliably determine the timing of seizure onset, espe-
cially if seizures originate from deep brain structures, 
and intracranial EEG recordings have demonstrated 
that seizure- related tachycardia is an ictal rather than a 
pre- ictal phenomenon22.

The side of the ictal onset zone does not seem to 
influence  the  risk  of  ictal  tachycardia23.  However, 
involvement of the temporal and orbitofrontal cortex, 
spread of seizure activity to the contralateral hemisphere 
and state of alertness might define the degree of ictal 
tachycardia23.

Other ictal cardiovascular manifestations lack precise 
prevalence figures, because blood pressure parameters 
are not routinely assessed during video- EEG recordings. 
Overall, most ictal cardiovascular signs are accompanied 
by a shift towards sympathetic dominance2. Increases 
in blood pressure can be seen across all focal seizure 
types, with the most marked increases being observed 
in focal- to- bilateral TCSs24. Peri- ictal blood pressure 
alterations have a similar time course to the concom-
itant tachycardia, suggesting modulation of arterial 
baroreflex  control25.  In  focal- to- bilateral  TCSs,  the  
attenuated baroreflex sensitivity extends throughout 
the postictal period, whereas no such postictal changes 
have been found in focal seizures26. In rare cases, TCSs 
elicit profound postictal hypotension that can coincide 
with postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES), that 
is, overall suppression of brain activity in the postictal 
period27. An electrical stimulation study in 12 individuals 
with epilepsy identified Brodmann area 25 as a potential 
symptomatogenic zone for peri- ictal hypotension28.

Arrhythmias. Most forms of cardiac arrhythmias can 
be observed in people with epilepsy, particularly in 
association with seizures29. However, the incidence of 
cardiac arrhythmias and the immediate effects of these

arrhythmias on the systemic circulation vary greatly8,30. 
Perhaps the most important types are ictal bradycar-
dia and asystole, given their impact on systemic blood 
flow and associated clinical events, including traumatic 
falls. Bradycardia is commonly defined as slowing of the 
heart rate below 60 bpm. Asymptomatic bradycardia is 
often observed in young, healthy individuals, and in 
particular, in trained athletes31. In symptomatic brady-
cardia, the heart rate is usually <50 bpm (reF.32). In most 
studies, IA is considered to be a seizure- related pause of 
regular QrS complexes of more than 3 s (reFS8,33). IA is 
typically preceded by heart rate deceleration, which 
is indicative of ictal suppression of sinus node activity. 

In some cases, IA is accompanied by a complete block of 
atrioventricular conduction8.

Ictal bradycardia has been reported to occur in up 
to 6.4% of focal seizures and in up to 13.6% of people 
with epilepsy undergoing video- EEG monitoring29. IA 
was detected in 0.32% of people with refractory focal 
epilepsy who were admitted for video- EEG monitoring8. 
People with epilepsy who experience IA have a 40% 
risk of recurrent IA33. IA seems to occur exclusively in 
focal impaired- awareness seizures and mostly in people 
with TLE8,33. The cerebral mechanisms underlying ictal 
bradycardia and IA are not fully understood. Seizure 
activity could modulate the CAN, causing increased

parasympathetic outflow, or indirectly provoke a vasova-
gal reflex. IA occurs in association with bilateral spread 
of seizure activity and is not specific to seizure activity in 
either the left or the right hemisphere8,33–35.

Long- term ECG monitoring in patients with refrac-
tory epilepsy was found to have a low diagnostic yield of 
clinically relevant arrhythmias. Four studies involving 
a total of 280 individuals with refractory epilepsy used 
implanted loop recorders to ascertain the prevalence 
of asystole36–39. Monitoring of these patients for up to 
3 years yielded an overall prevalence of 7%. Three of the 
studies, accounting for 261 patients, showed remark-
ably similar incidences of asystole (6%)36,37,39. Most 
of these events were short- lived and did not require 
pacemaker implantation. In the remaining small- scale 
study (n = 19), 21% of patients had longer- lasting asys-
tole that required pacemaker implantation, suggesting 
some bias in this study population38. Short- duration, 
non- sustained ventricular tachycardia was rare, affect-
ing only two individuals in one of the four trials39. The 
yield of long- term ECG screening might be increased 
by targeting special subgroups, including people with 
cardiac comorbidities40 or markers of cardiac electrical 
instability41,42.

Interestingly,  vagus  nerve  stimulation  seems  to 
reduce abnormally elevated levels of T- wave alternans, 
thereby stabilizing the electrical properties of the heart43. 
However, whether this intervention could help to reduce 
the risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular tach-
ycardia and ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) is currently 
unknown.

Syncope. Syncope is defined as transient loss of con-
sciousness caused by global cerebral hypoperfusion32. 
In  general,  asystole  lasting  for  8 s  or  longer  com-
monly leads to loss of consciousness and atonia44, and 

individuals with vasovagal syncope have a 27–42% of 
risk of falls and injuries45,46. Given that the average dura-
tion of IA is 20 s, most individuals with this condition  
will develop symptoms and signs of cerebral anoxia8. 
IA with subsequent syncope (ictal syncope) is charac-
terized by sudden loss of muscle tone during a focal 
impaired- awareness seizure and occurs mostly in peo-
ple with TLE8,47. Besides IA, ictal syncope can also result 
from systemic vasodilation with a subsequent drop 
in blood pressure (vasodepressive syncope) or from a 
combination of seizure- related cardioinhibition and 
vasodepression48. Because awareness is impaired dur-
ing these seizures, individuals with IA cannot act on 
the classic prodromal symptoms of syncope, thereby 
increasing the risk of serious injuries. Indeed, sudden 
falls and injuries are commonly reported by people with 
IA, with an average rate of around three falls per month 
in one case series49,50.

The high risk of IA recurrence and the frequent falls 
emphasize the need for timely diagnosis and preventive 
measures. A diagnosis of IA can be challenging, as the 
patient will typically not recall presyncopal symptoms, 
and the occurrence of convulsive syncope (stiffening and 
jerks) is easily misinterpreted as a TCS, especially in the 
context of TLE34. Reports of flaccid falls with injuries and 
other signs of syncope (for example, intense pallor, stiff-
ening, myoclonic jerks and gasping) during the course 
of a temporal lobe seizure should, however, prompt 
further examinations47 (FiG. 1). Holter ECG, implantable 
loop recording and/or video- EEG monitoring should 
be considered, depending on the seizure frequency and 
clinical context (for example, eligibility for epilepsy sur-
gery). However, not all seizures in individuals with IA 
will manifest with asystole. The short- term recurrence 
risk of IA was estimated at 40% (95% confidence inter-
val (CI): 32–50%)33. Therefore, the recording of one or

two seizures might not be sufficient to reject a clinical 
hypothesis of IA, and a larger number of seizures should 
be recorded33.

Retrospective  studies  suggest  that  IA  and  ictal 
syncope can be prevented by improving seizure con-
trol using antiseizure medication (ASM) or epilepsy 
surgery50–54. In individuals who are refractory to ASMs 
and are not suitable candidates for resective epilepsy sur-
gery, pacemaker implantation is advisable to reduce the 
risk of falls and injuries50–52,55. Retrospective case series 
indicate that pacemakers prevent syncope- related falls 
in most patients with IA, although individuals with pre-
dominant ictal vasodepression might not benefit from 
these devices50–52,55,56.

Respiratory manifestations
Polygraphic video- EEG recordings indicate that central 
apnoea with oxygen desaturation and increased CO2 lev-
els occurs in around one- third of seizures57. Ictal central 
apnoea is more frequent in temporal than in extratem-
poral epilepsy7,9, and the onset of ictal central apnoea in 
TLE is tightly linked to the time of spread of seizure activ-
ity to the temporal lobe contralateral to the seizure onset 
zone58. Direct electrical stimulation during intracranial 
EEG recordings revealed that transient central apnoea 
could be elicited by stimulating a limbic–paralimbic 
network, including the amygdala, hippocampus, ante-
rior parahippocampal and anteromedial fusiform gyri59  
and/or the perisylvian cortex60.

Implications for diagnostic work- up
Autonomic signs during seizures can aid localization of 
the seizure onset zone (Table 1) and might occur more 
frequently in epilepsies caused by certain aetiologies. 
Autonomic signs are most commonly seen in TLE and 
are often reported in insular epilepsies, although owing 
to the rarity of the latter epilepsies, controlled studies 
are lacking61. Most people with TLE exhibit at least 
one autonomic sign during video- EEG recordings62. 
Epigastric  sensations,  including  nausea,  bloating, 
cramping and stomach pain, are the most commonly 
reported autonomic manifestations in TLE62. These 
visceral symptoms are generally perceived to ascend 
through the chest to the head. Among people with focal 
epilepsies, epigastric auras are associated with a 74% 
probability of TLE63. If the epigastric aura evolves into a 
focal impaired- awareness seizure with oral and manual 
automatisms, the probability of TLE increases to 98%63.
Autonomic features might also point towards the 
epilepsy aetiology. Focal autonomic seizures64,65 and 
interictal autonomic dysfunction66,67 are more frequent 
in individuals with autoimmune encephalitis than in 
those with focal epilepsies of unknown cause. Therefore, 
autoimmune testing should be considered in patients 
with autonomic symptoms, particularly those with 
temporal MRI hyperintensities, behavioural changes, 
cognitive symptoms, speech problems and/or auto-
immune diseases66. Leucine- rich glioma- inactivated 1  
(LGI1) autoimmune encephalitis seems to be particularly 
strongly associated with ictal piloerection68. A survey 
reported autonomic seizures in up to one- quarter of 
individuals with LGI1 encephalitis; however, in most 

cases, these manifestations were not recognized at the 
initial presentation69. Autoimmune encephalitis, in 
particular N- methyl- d- aspartate receptor (NMDAR) 
encephalitis, can also manifest with interictal auto-
nomic changes67,70,71. Autonomic instability, including 
central hypoventilation and paroxysmal sympathetic 
hyperactivity, is a frequent reason for intensive care unit 
admission in people with NMDAR encephalitis70,71.

Prominent autonomic signs are also common in cer-
tain epilepsy syndromes, most notably Panayiotopoulos 
syndrome, in which children may present with auto-
nomic status epilepticus72. Other examples include 
Rett syndrome, SCN8A- related encephalopathy and 
Dravet syndrome. People with Rett syndrome can pres-
ent with various autonomic abnormalities, including 
erratic breathing with periodic hypopnea followed by 
hyperventilation73. SCN8A- related encephalopathy is 
characterized by generalized symmetric tonic seizures 
with prominent and alternating autonomic signs (brady-
arrhythmia and tachyarrhythmia, hypoventilation and 
hyperventilation, and flushing and cyanosis)74. Peri- ictal 
respiratory abnormalities, including airway obstruction 
and ataxic or paradoxical breathing, are more frequent 
in individuals with Dravet syndrome than in those with 
focal epilepsy75. Depression of CO2 chemoreception can 
persist as long as 4 h after the end of a seizure.

Anatomy and physiology of autonomic networks
Various areas throughout the brain — including the 
amygdala, anterior cingulate, insula, thalamus, hypo-
thalamus, periaqueductal grey matter, parabrachial 
nucleus and several medullary regions — regulate the 
central processing of autonomic responses76 (FiG.  2). 
This CAN has a crucial role in homeostasis of bodily 
functions, conscious visceral perception and regula-
tion of emotional responses via the sympathetic and 
parasympathetic nervous systems77.

The CAN is a highly integrated, reciprocal, intercon-
nected network that displays task and division specifici-
ties. Neuroimaging experiments have revealed that the 
central processing of autonomic function is mediated by 
divergent regulatory networks with differential involve-
ment in affective, cognitive and somatosensory–motor 
tasks78. Sympathetic- associated brain regions predom-
inate in executive and salience processing networks, 
whereas parasympathetic regions have prominent roles 
in the default mode network. A set of brain regions 
comprising the left amygdala, right and left insula and 
midcingulate cortices is consistently activated across all 
tasks and, thus, constitutes the core of the CAN78. The 
interconnections between the central regions that reg-
ulate sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow could 
explain why seizures with apparently similar ictal onset 
zones and propagation pathways can evoke contrasting 
autonomic responses79.

Seizures are thought to influence CAN function 
through multiple pathways. In addition to direct activa-
tion of the central to peripheral autonomic routes, ictal 
autonomic alterations might result from reflex responses 
to the behavioural effects of seizures (FiG. 3) and from the 
effects of catecholamines released by the adrenal glands8,80.  
The occurrence of oscillatory heart rate patterns during

of such reflexes with the direct pathway79.

Many non- seizure- related factors modulate the ictal 
autonomic response, and the extent of the ictal alter-
ations depends on the integrity of the ANS. People 
with  epilepsy  frequently  display  blunted  interictal 
HRV81, which is thought to reflect reduced vagal and 
increased sympathetic modulation. Impaired HRV 
seems to be particularly severe in people with TLE and 
difficult- to- treat epilepsies81. The aetiology of the HRV 
derangements in epilepsy is unclear, but they could 
reflect seizure- related or treatment- related effects on the 
central and peripheral autonomic networks. Some evi-
dence suggests that excessive brainstem atrophy is asso-
ciated with blunted HRV in focal epilepsy82. Functional 
imaging studies demonstrated abnormalities in key 
autonomic regulatory brain regions in individuals at 
high risk of SUDEP83.

Autonomic alterations following ASM initiation have 
also been described, although the precise contribution 
of ASMs to the risk of severe cardiovascular disease and 

fatal arrhythmias has been a matter for debate1,30. The 
association between ASM use and autonomic function 
is likely to be multifactorial, with seizure control and 
specific drug properties as important variables. Sodium 
channel- blocking  ASMs  —  including  carbamaze-
pine, lacosamide, lamotrigine and phenytoin — might 
decrease the heart rate, particularly at high dosages1,30. 
Concomitant non- epilepsy medications that affect the 
ANS, such as β blockers, could also potentially influence 
ictal autonomic responses, although no studies have for-
mally investigated this possibility. In addition, ageing is 
known to impair adaptation to physiological stressors84, 
but the implications for ictal autonomic changes in  
people with epilepsy are unknown.

Evidence suggests that the presence of cardiovascu-
lar conditions lowers the threshold for seizure- related 
autonomic complications85. For instance, the presence 
of underlying cardiovascular conditions in people with 
epilepsy increases the likelihood of developing IA early 
in the disease course — even in individuals with refrac-
tory epilepsy, IA tends to occur at a comparatively late

modulate the ictal autonomic response79. Seizures can potentially affect the central autonomic network (CAN) through 
multiple pathways. Besides direct activation of the central to peripheral autonomic routes, ictal autonomic alterations 
could also result from reflexes in response to the behavioural effects of seizures. Stimulation of the CAN might result in 
selective sympathetic or parasympathetic activation or nonspecific autonomic activation. The extent of the ictal autonomic 
response will depend on various clinical determinants, including factors related to the interictal sympathovagal balance,

stage85. These findings suggest that cardiovascular condi-
tions could serve as predisposing factors for early- onset 
IA in otherwise easy- to- treat epilepsies.

Only a few clinical studies have examined the influ-
ence of the sleep–wake cycle and circadian factors on 
the ictal autonomic patterns86. These studies suggested 
that seizures arising from sleep elicit more prominent 
autonomic  changes  than  seizures  occurring  while 
the individual is awake. Neurohumoral factors might 
also shape the ictal autonomic response, with some 
evidence indicating that chronic epilepsy affects the 
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis87. For instance, 
the neurohumoral response to acute psychological stress 
was higher in individuals with left TLE than in healthy 
controls88. Cortisol responses to stress were greater 
among patients with a higher seizure burden88.

Autonomic manifestations and sudden death in 
epilepsy
People with epilepsy have a 24- fold increased risk of 
dying suddenly compared with the general population89. 
In the general population without epilepsy, SCD is prob-
ably the most frequent cause of sudden death among 
adults, with acute ischaemic events being the main 
driver90 (box 1). However, sudden death in people with 
epilepsy tends to occur at a younger age than SCD in the 
absence of epilepsy, and is not usually associated with 
overt structural or genetic cardiac pathology91. These 
apparent differences are reflected in the definition of 
SUDEP as a special category of death (box 1).

The exact determination of the underlying mech-
anisms and the labelling of a sudden death as SUDEP 
or SCD in a patient with epilepsy can be challenging, 
given that most cases of sudden death are unwitnessed 

and post- mortem examinations are often lacking40,92. 
Inevitably, some cases are falsely labelled as SCD or as 
probable SUDEP, and the potential for overlap between 
SCD and SUDEP probably goes unrecognized in some 
patients40,92. Indeed, as delineated in box 2, some sud-
den unexpected deaths fulfil the criteria for either SCD 
(recent and lethal cardiac pathology demonstrated at 
post- mortem examination) or SUDEP (no lethal cardiac 
cause previously known or shown at the time of death 
or at post- mortem examination), whereas others are 
compatible with both diagnoses (lethal primary cardiac 
arrhythmia recorded at the time of death but no other 
known cardiac pathology)92.

SUDEP incidence and risk factors
The reported incidence of SUDEP varies considerably 
between studies93,94. These discrepancies could be attrib-
utable to various confounding factors, including knowl-
edge about SUDEP among health- care professionals and 
medical coroners, post- mortem policies and structures 
of national death registries, as well as other inherent 
limitations of retrospective data collection. In some 
studies, the incidence of SUDEP in children and adoles-
cents was reported to be much lower than in adults93,94; 
however, research from Canada and Sweden yielded 
rates of 1.11–1.45 per 1,000 person- years in children 
and adolescents with epilepsy95,96, which is similar to 
the incidence reported in adults with epilepsy (1.20 per 
1,000 person- years)93. The relatively high incidence in 
young people might explain why SUDEP ranks second 
only to stroke in terms of potential life lost due to neu-
rological disorders, despite considerably higher death 
rates in conditions such as Parkinson disease, stroke and 
Alzheimer disease97.

780 | December 2021 | volume 17 

0123456789();: www.nature.com/nrneurolReviewsWe note that these estimates apply to all people 
with epilepsy and do not consider the type of epilepsy 
or disease course. The individual SUDEP risk depends 
on disease severity and treatment response. In particu-
lar, people with medically refractory epilepsies and 
potential candidates for epilepsy surgery have an higher 
SUDEP risk than those with well controlled epilep-
sies94. However, SUDEP can occur early in the disease 
course or in individuals with a condition that is usually 
considered benign98,99.

Case–control and epidemiological studies have iden-
tified numerous risk factors for SUDEP, the strongest 
and most consistently reported of which relate to dis-
ease severity and seizure activity94,100. In particular, TCSs 
have been linked to elevated risk, with reports of a strong 
correlation between the number of TCSs per year and 
SUDEP risk101–104. Nocturnal TCSs, but not other types 
of nocturnal seizures, also predict an increased risk of 
SUDEP102. In addition, lack of nocturnal supervision 
and living alone are associated with an increased SUDEP 
risk102,105,106. Importantly, accumulation of these risk fac-
tors can potentiate the individual risk; for example, peo-
ple with TCSs who live alone have a 67- fold elevated risk 
of SUDEP102.

Proposed pathomechanisms
TCS- triggered cerebral suppression–apnoea–asystole. 
Most witnessed SUDEP events occur in the aftermath 
of a TCS94,107, suggesting that generalized seizure activity 
triggers pathomechanisms that impair regulation of auto-
nomic pathways and facilitate breakdown of cardiorespi-
ratory function. In fact, all recorded post- ictal SUDEP 
events that occurred in epilepsy monitoring units under 
continuous supervision with video, EEG and ECG were 
preceded by a TCS, followed by a predictable cascade of 
cardiorespiratory dysfunction108. In the aftermath of a TCS, 
abnormal breathing patterns were observed that eventu-
ally developed into periods of apnoea with subsequent  
episodes of bradycardia and terminal asystole.

Another characteristic feature of the early postictal 
phase was the generalized flattening of the EEG trace, 

Box 1 | Definitions of SCD and sudden SUDEP

Sudden cardiac death
Sudden cardiac death (ScD) refers to sudden and unexpected death occurring within 
1 h of the onset of symptoms or occurring in patients found dead within 24 h of being 
asymptomatic, and presumably due to a cardiac arrhythmia or haemodynamic 
catastrophe178.

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SuDeP) is a category of death in people  
with epilepsy that occurs under benign circumstances and in the absence of known 
structural causes of death, that is, not due to drowning, injury, intoxication or other 
internal or external factors179. evidence of a preceding seizure may or not may not be 
present. ‘Definite SuDeP’ is confirmed if a post- mortem examination does not reveal  
an alternative cause of death. If no post- mortem report is available but potentially  
lethal alternative causes have been excluded and all other criteria are met, the death is 
labelled as ‘probable SuDeP’. The term ‘possible SuDeP’ is used in cases with competing 
causes of death or where data are insufficient to reasonably allow classification of  
the cause of death. The term ‘SuDeP plus’ applies when a patient also had other diseases 
that might have contributed to the death but there are no clues that the alternative 
condition has truly caused it. cases in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation prevented 
the death are termed ‘near- SuDeP’179.

reflecting PGES108. The origin and clinical importance 
of PGES is not yet fully understood109, but it seems to 
be a necessary — though not sufficient — condition for 
the neurovegetative breakdown in TCS- related SUDEP 
in humans. In several animal models of genetic epilep-
sies, PGES occurred in association with a seizure- linked 
‘depolarization wave’, which spread from cortical areas to 
the brainstem, ultimately suppressing cardiorespiratory 
brainstem networks110–113.

Structural and functional imaging studies in people 
who subsequently died as a result of SUDEP and indi-
viduals at high risk of SUDEP identified changes in key 
central autonomic regulatory regions114–117. Ictal auto-
nomic dysfunction might exacerbate deficits in these 
brain regions, as the extent of brain volume loss among 
patients with TCS has been linked to the severity of 
peri- ictal hypoxaemia118.

Deficits in serotonergic signalling might also be 
involved in seizure- related breathing disturbances. 
Animal data suggest that postictal deficits in serotoner-
gic neurotransmission can impair the arousal reaction to 
postictally elevated CO2 levels and cause hypoventilation 
or respiratory arrest119, which can be prevented by admin-
istration of serotonin reuptake inhibitors120. In humans, 
blood serotonin levels were found to be elevated after 
seizures without ictal or postictal central apnoea but not 
after seizures with breathing disturbances121. Moreover, 
in a post- mortem study, depletion of brainstem neurons 
involved in serotonin and galanin signalling was greater 
in SUDEP cases than in controls122. We note that around 
75% of people who succumb to SUDEP are found in 
the prone position, which is likely to further aggravate  
postictal breathing disturbances108,123.

Together, these findings strengthen the notion that 
postictal respiratory dysfunction is a key event in the fatal 
cascade of TCS- triggered SUDEP. The resulting severe 
hypoxaemia subsequently causes bradycardia and termi-
nal asystole124, possibly facilitated by impaired activity of 
cardiorespiratory brainstem neurons. However, the exact 
mechanisms involved in the transition from a ‘usual’ to 
a fatal TCS remain to be elucidated.

Ictal asystole. For many years, IA was thought to be 
a possible mechanism of SUDEP. However, several 
observations indicate that IA is not invariably linked to 
SUDEP. First, IA is triggered by abnormal brain activ-
ity, which is in turn terminated by the resulting cerebral 
hypoperfusion. Hence, it is not surprising that features 
of IA resemble those of vasovagal syncope, including 
its benign nature125. Second, in one study, all but one 
of the reported IA cases had self- limiting asystole8. 
In the one case that was not classified as self- limiting, 
IA lasted for 44 s, after which the patient was success-
fully resuscitated126. The longest episode of IA reported 
to date spontaneously resolved after 96 s, casting fur-
ther doubt on a causal link between prolonged IA and 
SUDEP127. Third, two individuals with ictal bradycar-
dia and IA succumbed to SUDEP despite having well 
functioning cardiac pacemakers128,129, strengthening the 
assumption that SUDEP is not attributable to IA. Last, 
the brain anoxia that results from IA terminates seizure 
activity, leading to shorter seizure duration without

Box 2 | Constellations of sudden death in epilepsy

We propose the following classification system for the various potentially overlapping 
constellations of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SuDeP) and sudden cardiac 
death (ScD).

SUDEP and not SCD
Sudden unexpected death without a previously known lethal cardiac cause shown at 
the time of death or demonstrated at post- mortem examination.

SUDEP and SCD
Sudden unexpected death with a lethal primary cardiac arrhythmia recorded at the 
time of death and no other known cardiac pathology.

SUDEP plus and not SCD
Sudden unexpected death with a previously known cardiac pathology but no recent 
and lethal cardiac event recorded during the event or demonstrated at post- mortem 
examination.

SCD and not SUDEP
Sudden unexpected death with recent and lethal cardiac pathology demonstrated at 
post- mortem examination.

development to bilateral TCS, which is likely to reduce 
the risk of SUDEP55,130.

TCS- triggered ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. 
A rare and possibly under- reported SUDEP mechanism 
was documented in a monitored patient who experi-
enced sudden onset of VT/VF following a focal- to- 
bilateral TCS. This event was labelled as near- SUDEP, 
as the patient was successfully resuscitated. Another four 
cases of VT/VF occurring in the aftermath of a TCS were 
reported and were labelled as near- SUDEP or SUDEP30. 
No cardiac pathologies were found in these patients, sug-
gesting that the VT/VF was triggered by seizure- related 
alterations in cardiac properties. VT/VF and SCD are 
known to be facilitated by cardiac repolarization abnor-
malities, including prolonged or shortened QT intervals, 
as well as increased levels of QT dispersion and T- wave 
alternans131,132.

Importantly, abnormal cardiac repolarization features  
are frequently found in people with chronic epilepsy, 
both in the interictal period and in association with 
seizures30,133. Transient, profound alterations of QT 
intervals and T- wave alternans are especially common 
in association with TCS17,134, probably owing to exces-
sive catecholamine release and strong sympathetic 
activation25.  This  observation  provides  a  plausible 
explanation  for  the  sudden  onset  of  VT/VF  in  the 
aftermath of a TCS in people without apparent cardiac 
disease. In a community- based study, the risk of VT/VF  
was found to be threefold higher in patients with epi-
lepsy than in the general population135. Most of the 
VT/VF events occurred in patients with pre- existing 
or  acute  heart  conditions40.  Some  cases,  however, 
remained unexplained and could be classified as SUDEP 
or near- SUDEP, supporting the idea of a partial overlap 
between SUDEP and SCD40.

Interictal ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. 
Eyewitness reports suggest that around 10% of witnessed 
SUDEP events occur in the absence of apparent seizure 
activity107,136, indicating that seizures are not required as 
proximate triggers for SUDEP. It is reasonable to assume 
that in some or even most of these cases, sudden death

was caused by cardiac arrhythmias. This assumption is 
supported by findings that most cases of sudden cardiac 
arrest in epilepsy occur without evidence of a preceding 
seizure40,137, and that cardiac comorbidities are par-
ticularly prevalent among people with epilepsy30,138,139. 
For instance, the combined 2010, 2013 and 2015 US 
National Health Interview Surveys indicated that adults 
with a history of epilepsy more often report heart dis-
ease (21%) than those without such a history (12%)139. 
Accordingly, people with chronic epilepsy frequently 
display established predictors of cardiac mortality and 
SCD (for example, impaired HRV and abnormal cardiac 
repolarization indices) in the interictal period30,81.

These  interictal  alterations  could  relate  to  the 
comorbid heart conditions but could also result from 
incremental subtle damage of cardiac tissue caused by 
repeated seizures and related cardiotoxic catecholamine 
release, hypoxaemia, and inflammatory and metabolic 
factors30,91. The structural correlates of such repetitive 
micro- injuries might be perivascular and interstitial 
fibrotic microlesions in the heart, which are found in 
around one- third of patients with epilepsy who undergo 
a post- mortem examination91,140. These seizure- related 
cardiac changes could help explain why ECG meas-
ures of ventricular function, such as myocardial strain 
and left systolic or diastolic ventricular function, were 
found to be impaired in people with epilepsy without 
any known cardiovascular disease141–143.

A rarer cause of seizure- mediated ventricular dys-
function in epilepsy is the Takotsubo syndrome (also 
known as apical ballooning), which is characterized 
by acute onset of heart failure1,30. Case series suggest 
that this syndrome is strongly linked to TCS and the 
related excessive release of catecholamines1,30. Animal 
studies of acquired epilepsies also revealed modified 
expression levels of cardiac ion channels (for example, 
SCN1A, SCN5A and HCN2), leading to altered electrical 
properties of the heart144.

The acquired cardiac changes described above are 
all likely to cause or contribute to disturbed excitation, 
conduction and repolarization of the heart, thereby serv-
ing as potential catalysts for the generation and mainte-
nance of fatal arrhythmias. The concept that the heart 
and coronary vasculature are incrementally damaged by 
repeated seizures, resulting in electrical and mechanical 
dysfunction, has been termed ‘epileptic heart’91.

In addition to acquired alterations of cardiac prop-
erties, genetic defects might contribute to both epi-
lepsy and cardiac arrhythmias in some individuals. 
Potential contributors to ‘cardiocerebral’ channelop-
athies include the spectrum of mutations in long QT 
syndrome genes (for example, SCN5A,  KCNQ1 and 
KCNH2) and some gene mutations typically associated 
with epilepsy (for example, SCN8A, CDKL5, CNTNAP2 
and GRIN2A)30,145,146. Some of these mutations have been 
found in people who succumbed to SUDEP, emphasizing 
the possible contribution of cardiocerebral phenotypes 
to SUDEP146,147.

Interictal cerebral suppression–apnoea–asystole. Interictal  
cardiorespiratory dysfunction might contribute to the 
heterogeneity and complexity of SUDEP pathogenesis. 

0123456789();: www.nature.com/nrneurolReviewsIn two individuals during and shortly after intracranial 
EEG recording and in one individual in the context 
of probable pneumonia during scalp EEG recordings, 
sudden death was preceded by fluctuating breathing 
and heart rate and generalized EEG flattening without 
apparent seizure activity148. The sequence and character-
istics of the events leading to death in these individuals 
resembled those of the TCS- triggered cascade described 
above, prompting the hypothesis of non- seizure- related 
primary suppression of brainstem activity, affecting 
respiratory function.

Summary. The evidence outlined above indicates that 
SUDEP is predominantly caused by TCS- triggered 
postictal apnoea and asystole, with other mechanisms 
accounting  for  a  small  proportion  of  cases  (FiG.  4). 
A fixed sequence of apnoea followed by asystole has been 
observed; no case has yet been reported with asystole 
but no apnoea. In view of the many facets of interictal 
and seizure- related cardiovascular and respiratory auto-
nomic alterations, the pathophysiology of sudden death 
in people with epilepsy is likely to be heterogeneous. 
Acquired or genetic alterations in autonomic networks, 
neuronal signalling and cardiac properties contribute 
to an elevated risk of sudden death. It is important to 
distinguish SUDEP from SCD, although these entities 
partially overlap (box 2) and might be incorrectly labelled 
owing to a lack of post- mortem evidence or witnessing 
of the death.

Prevention of sudden death in epilepsy
The prevention of SUDEP and SCD is an important 
objective for the epilepsy field. Unfortunately, no ran-
domized controlled trial or other high- quality evidence 
is currently available to support the effectiveness of a 
specific intervention for preventing these events30,93,149,150. 
However, some preliminary evidence suggests that 
improving seizure control and nocturnal supervision 
can  reduce  SUDEP  risk,  which  might  explain  why 
access to specialized epilepsy services is associated with 
incremental reductions in the hazard of premature 
mortality151.

TCS- related SUDEP
The role of TCS in the chain of events that directly lead to 
SUDEP in the majority of cases108 strongly suggests that 
the better the control of TCS, the lower the SUDEP risk. 
Accordingly, non- adherence to ASMs and lack of ASM 
prescription, both of which carry a substantial risk of 
breakthrough TCS, were found to be associated with an 
increased risk of SUDEP93,102. Furthermore, in a Swedish 
nationwide case–control study, ASM polytherapy was 
found to be slightly more protective than monother-
apy when the data were adjusted for TCS frequency102. 
Similarly, in a meta- analysis of phase III randomized 
controlled  trials  of  add- on  ASM,  individuals  who 
received an additional ASM had a sevenfold- lower 
incidence of SUDEP than those allocated to add- on 
placebo152.

Fig. 4 | Key pathophysiological events in the SUDEP cascade. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has a 
spectrum of heterogeneous causes but is predominantly attributable to tonic–clonic seizure (TCS)- triggered postictal 
apnoea–asystole. Less- frequent causes can include the sequence of cerebral suppression–apnoea–asystole without a 
preceding seizure, or seizure- related or non- seizure- related arrhythmias. SUDEP and sudden cardiac death (SCD) are 
partly overlapping entities, and the presence of pre- existing or acute cardiac comorbidities might help to differentiate 
between these two events. SUDEP contrasts with self- limiting autonomic features as it is strongly linked to TCSs, whereas 
ictal apnoea and ictal asystole are associated with focal — mostly temporal lobe — seizures. Another contrast concerns 
the timing of the event: SUDEP typically occurs in the aftermath of a TCS, and ictal manifestations of asystole or apnoea 
have not been linked to SUDEP. PGES, postictal generalized EEG suppression.

With regard to surgical interventions, the aforemen-
tioned Swedish study found that vagus nerve stimulation 
was associated with a reduced SUDEP risk102, consist-
ent with evidence that SUDEP incidence in patients 
treated with vagus nerve stimulation decreases as a 
function of treatment duration153. The impact of epilepsy 
surgery on the risk of SUDEP is more controversial93,154: 
lower mortality rates were observed in successful versus 
failed TLE surgery155–158, but comparisons of operated 
and non- operated individuals produced conflicting 
results102,159. Overall, promotion of treatment adherence 
and state- of- the- art practice guidelines to decrease TCS 
seems to be an appropriate approach, despite a lack of 
high- quality evidence that such practices will prevent 
SUDEP149.

A Cochrane Review and the American Academy of 
Neurology–American Epilepsy Society SUDEP guide-
lines concluded that only very- low- certainty (Grading 
of  Recommendations  Assessment,  Development 
and  Evaluation)  and  level  C  (modified  Grading 
Recommendations Assessment) evidence was available 
to support the preventive impact of nocturnal supervi-
sion on SUDEP risk93,150. This evidence was derived from 
retrospective case–control studies102,105,106,160 and is sup-
ported by the observation that the majority of SUDEP 
events occur at night, during sleep in non- supervised 
individuals101,108,136. Epilepsy monitoring unit data from 
the MORTEMUS study also suggest that an immediate 
nonspecific postictal intervention from a caregiver is 
likely to prevent SUDEP108. Such timely intervention 
might be promoted by the use of wearable devices that 
reliably detect TCS and trigger an alarm161,162 (see below). 
A retrospective study found reduced SUDEP rates in res-
idential care facilities that offered additional measures 
to intensify nocturnal supervision106. No data are yet 
available to support the impact of specific TCS- detecting 
devices on the risk of SUDEP.

A number of other SUDEP prevention methods are 
being considered with the specific objective of reduc-
ing obstructive and/or centrally mediated post- TCS 
respiratory distress, including lattice pillows, post- ictal 
O2  therapy,  serotonergic  drugs,  opiate  and  adeno-
sine receptor antagonists and implantable devices149. 
Although some animal studies support the value of 
such interventions to prevent SUDEP, no human study 
is yet available, and an urgent need exists to develop 
appropriately  designed  controlled  trials  of  SUDEP 
prevention strategies.

Open communication about SUDEP risk, if appro-
priate,  is  a  particularly  important  step  to  prevent 
SUDEP, as it can promote treatment adherence and 
guide  lifestyle  choices,  thereby  improving  seizure 
control. Various surveys indicate that most people 
with epilepsy and their families prefer to be informed 
about SUDEP by their care providers, even if the risk 
is low163. Therefore, the inclusion of SUDEP informa-
tion is strongly recommended when counselling people 
with epilepsy and their relatives93. Counselling should 
be tailored to the individual with a view to improving 
motivation regarding medication adherence or new 
treatments, as well as allowing other protective measures 
to be taken (for example, not living or sleeping alone 

and use of wearable devices) for those at high risk, while 
avoiding inappropriate fear of SUDEP for those at low 
risk. Checklists are available to monitor SUDEP risk 
over time but they cannot provide reliable risk estimates. 
A recent retrospective study, which used Bayesian mod-
els to examine 1,273 individuals with epilepsy, showed 
that personalized model predictions were superior to 
population- based estimates for predicting SUDEP164.

SCD in people with epilepsy
Data regarding prevention of SCD in epilepsy are scarce. 
As  TCS  might  trigger  myocardial  injuries  or  even 
infarction1,30, one might expect that reducing TCS would 
also reduce risk of SCD. The overall risk reduction is 
likely to be minimal, however, as most SCD events are 
not linked to seizures40,137. In view of the cardiac effects 
of chronic epilepsy, such as HRV suppression and car-
diac repolarization abnormalities30,91, people with epi-
lepsy are likely to benefit from alternative strategies, 
including cardiovascular risk assessments and appro-
priate preventive treatments. Some data indicate that 
enzyme- inducing ASMs have a negative impact on lipid 
profiles30,91, although whether these drugs increase SCD 
risk in people with epilepsy is not yet known. Genetic 
screening for cardiocerebral channelopathies should 
also be considered in individuals with epilepsy who have 
unexplained arrhythmias30,145,146.

Wearable devices
Non- invasive wearable devices to improve seizure detec-
tion are being developed at a rapid pace. Such devices 
have an important role in monitoring disease activity, as 
video- EEG studies have demonstrated that seizure dia-
ries are notoriously unreliable165. On average, individuals 
with epilepsy are thought to report fewer than half of 
their seizures165. Seizure under- reporting is a particu-
lar concern in patients with focal impaired- awareness 
seizures or nocturnal seizures165.

Improved monitoring might also decrease the risk 
of seizure- related complications, including SUDEP. 
Autonomic features are promising targets for seizure 
detection devices, as these features are very sensitive 
to physiological stressors. To date, validation stud-
ies for these devices have been heterogeneous with 
regard to the study population, range of seizure type, 
duration of follow- up, recording settings and the gold 
standard applied166,167. Most studies that have used auto-
nomic features for seizure detection have been pilot or 
proof- of- principle studies that lack the long- term and 
real- time ambulatory monitoring that will be needed 
to  obtain  reliable  performance  data  and  usability 
outcomes21. Various strategies have been applied, includ-
ing single- modality algorithms based on heart rate, 
HRV or QRS morphology, and multimodal algorithms 
using various combinations of heart rate, corrected 
QT interval, oxygen saturation, electrodermal activ-
ity and accelerometry. The best performance is likely 
to be achieved if autonomic modalities are combined, 
because single- modality algorithms yield unacceptably 
high false- alarm rates21. Standards for testing and vali-
dation of seizure detection devices have been proposed

strated that non- EEG seizure detection devices (includ-
ing autonomic and non- autonomic sensors) can detect 
the occurrence of TCS with high sensitivity (≥90%) and 
low false- alarm rates (down to 0.2 per day)166. Detection 
of non- convulsive seizures is more challenging, as the 
most frequently applied autonomic modalities — heart 
rate and electrodermal activity — fail to reliably distin-
guish these events from other physiological stressors. 
HRV measures might provide an alternative approach 
to detect these seizures168,169. A recent phase II study 
demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach in 
individuals  with  marked  ictal  autonomic  changes, 
characterized by an increase in heart rate of more than 
50 bpm (reF.169). The HRV algorithm had a sensitivity of 
90% with variable false- alarm rates (overall 1.0 per 24 h, 
night- time 0.1 per night). Pulse wave features other than 
heart rate and HRV can also be extracted from photo-
plethysmography and might display specific changes 
before,  during  and  after  focal  impaired- awareness 
seizures170. Machine- learning techniques are another 
important avenue to explore to improve detection of 
non- convulsive seizures171.

Various surveys have highlighted considerable inter-
est in the use of wearable technology across the epilepsy 
community172. User studies indicated that removable 
but securely fitted, wireless and comfortable wearable 
devices are preferred for seizure detection173. Long- term 
home- based trials are needed to explore the added value 
of these devices. Autonomic interventions can also be 
applied via neuromodulation devices. Application of 
additional vagus nerve stimulation pulses triggered 
by seizure- related increases in heart rate might alleviate 
seizure severity174.

Conclusions and future perspectives
As discussed in this Review, the field of autonomic dys-
function in epilepsy has proved to be extremely rich, 
complex and relevant to the most severe outcomes 
affecting persons with epilepsy, including premature and 

sudden death (SCD or SUDEP). However, our under-
standing of many aspects of interictal and peri- ictal 
autonomic changes associated with seizure disorders 
remains limited, and more research is required. In par-
ticular, large- scale epilepsy monitoring unit studies are 
needed to comprehensively assess all relevant neuro-
vegetative functions and their alterations in epilepsy. 
In addition, researchers can take advantage of the rap-
idly developing field of health- directed wearable devices, 
including seizure detectors, to conduct ambulatory stud-
ies. Wearable devices are particularly attractive in view 
of their potential to grade seizure severity over time and 
to capture circadian changes in autonomic control (for 
example, sleep- to- awake HRV)15,161,175. Epilepsy cohorts 
need to be large enough to enable prospective case–
control studies of the most relevant clinical end points, 
including sudden death.

Specific  investigations  should  also  focus  on  the 
long- term impact of medical and surgical epilepsy treat-
ments on cardiovascular function and mortality, espe-
cially in elderly individuals and patients with late- onset 
epilepsy, who have the greatest risks of cardio vascular 
complications. Further exploration of the central regu-
lation  of  autonomic  functions  and  its  disorders  in 
people with epilepsy, taking advantage of the neuro-
imaging, neurophysiology (including intracerebral 
EEG) and genetic investigations performed in this 
population, should also be encouraged. Besides acquir-
ing new knowledge, efforts should be made to provide 
evidence- based practice guidelines for autonomic inves-
tigations in people with epilepsy. In particular, recom-
mendations are needed regarding the clinical indications 
for basic and more sophisticated cardiovascular explora-
tions. Finally, controlled trials are urgently needed to test 
the impact of various interventions on the risk of prema-
ture death, SCD and SUDEP, including usage of readily 
available seizure detection devices and other methods of 
nocturnal supervision.
