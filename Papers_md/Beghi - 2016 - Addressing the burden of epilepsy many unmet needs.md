Epilepsy   is   a  heterogeneous   clinical   condition   characterized   by   recurrent   unprovoked   seizures,   their
causes  and   complications.   The   incidence,   prevalence   and   mortality   of   epilepsy   vary   with   age,   place   and
time  contributing   to  a  variable   extent   to  the   burden   of  the   disease.   Diagnostic   misclassiﬁcation   may   have
strong   impact   on  personal   and   societal   reﬂections   of   the   disease   in   light   of   its   clinical   manifestations
and   the   need   for   chronic   treatment.   Epilepsy   accounts   for   a   signiﬁcant   proportion   of   the   world’s   disease
burden   ranking   fourth   after   tension-type   headache,   migraine   and   Alzheimer   disease.   Among   neurolog-
ical  diseases,   it   accounts   for   the   highest   disability-adjusted   life   year   rates   both   in   men   and   in   women.
Although   epilepsy   is  self-remitting   in   up   to  50%   of   cases,   variable   long-term   prognostic   patterns   can   be
identiﬁed   based   on   the   response   to  the   available   treatments.   Epilepsy   carries   an   overall   increased   risk
of   premature   mortality   with   variable   estimates   across   countries.   Premature   mortality   predominates   in
patients   aged   less   than   50   years,   with  epilepsies   due   to  structural/metabolic   conditions,   with   generalized
tonic-clonic   seizures,   and   seizures   not   remitting   under   treatment.   Among   deaths   directly   attributable
to   epilepsy   or   seizures,   included   are   sudden   unexpected   death   in   epilepsy   (SUDEP),   status   epilepticus,
accidents,   drowning,   unintentional   injuries,   and   suicide.   Somatic   and   psychiatric   disorders   prevail   in
patients  with   epilepsy   than   in   people   without   epilepsy.   Asthma,   migraine   and   cerebral   tumors   tend   to
occur   more   frequently   in   younger   adults   while   cardiovascular   disorders,   stroke,   dementia   and   menin-
gioma  predominate   in   the   elderly.   As   being   a  fairly   common   clinical   condition   affecting   all   ages   and
requiring   long-term   (sometimes   lifelong)   treatment,   epilepsy   carries   high   health   care   costs   for   the  soci-
ety.  Direct   costs   peak   in   the   ﬁrst   year   after   diagnosis   and   then   vary   according   to  the   severity   of  the
disease,   the  response   to   treatment,   and   the   presence   of   comorbidity.   Although   in   several   countries   the
costs   of  epilepsy   are   met   by   the   national   health   systems,   out-of-pocket   costs   may   be  a  relevant   fraction
of   the   overall   costs,   especially   in   countries   where   the   public   management   of   health   care   is   suboptimal
or   non-existent.   Epilepsy   strongly   affects   patients’   independence,   psychological   health   and   emotional
adjustment.   Epilepsy   impairs   all   aspects   of   health-related   quality   of  life.   Awareness   and   attitudes   of   the
public  about   epilepsy   may   signiﬁcantly   affect   the   burden   of  the   disease.   All   these   factors   add   to  the  burden
of   the  disease.   However,   many   of  the   factors   implicated   in   the  onset   of  epilepsy,   its  course   and   treatment
can   be  favorably   addressed   with   appropriate   strategic   plans.   More   research   is   needed   to  investigate   and
manage   the   medical   and   psychosocial   implications   of   epilepsy.

1.  Introduction

Epilepsy  is  a  highly  heterogeneous  clinical  condition  charac-
terized  by  recurrent  unprovoked  seizures  with  their  causes  and
biological,  psychological  and  social  complications.  All  these  fac-
tors  add  to  the  burden  of  the  disease  and  represent  a  relevant
source  of  needs  for  patients,  caregivers  and  caring  physicians,  and
have  a  heavy  economic  impact  at  the  societal  level.  The  incidence,
prevalence  and  mortality  of  epilepsy  vary  with  age,  place  and
time  contributing  to  the  variability  of  the  burden  of  the  disease.

The  observed  differences  can  be  explained  by  diagnostic  misclas-
siﬁcation,  the  population’s  and  patient’s  genetic  background,  the
distribution  of  some  environmental  risk  factors,  the  socio-cultural
context,  the  access  to  treatments  and,  not  least,  the  deﬁnitions  used
for  the  diagnosis  of  the  disease.

2.  Deﬁnitions  of  seizures  and  epilepsy

One  of  the  problems  with  the  burden  of  epilepsy  is  repre-
sented  by  misdiagnosis.  Diagnostic  misclassiﬁcation  is  one  possible
explanation  for  the  inconsistencies  between  incidence  and  lifetime
prevalence  of  epilepsy  when  comparing  developed  and  develop-
ing  countries  [1].  The  absence  of  diagnostic  aids  (laboratory  tests,
EEG  and  imaging  studies)  in  developing  countries  may   result  in

erroneously  classifying  as  epileptic  seizures  psychogenic  non-
epileptic  seizures  (PNES)  and  other  paroxysmal  events.  Even  in
countries  where  the  diagnostic  resources  are  fully  available,  mis-
diagnosis  is  not  uncommon.  Interrater  reliability  for  the  diagnosis
of  PNES  by  video-EEG  monitoring  is  only  moderate  [2].  Misclassiﬁ-
cation  may   also  refer  to  seizure  type.  Acute  symptomatic  seizures,
deﬁned  as  clinical  seizures  occurring  at  the  time  of  a  systemic  insult
or  in  close  temporal  association  with  a  documented  brain  insult
[3],  are  sometimes  included  in  epidemiological  studies,  leading
to  the  increase  of  all  epidemiological  indexes,  and  inevitably  lead
to  overtreatment  and  to  avoidable  negative  attitudes  and  stigma.
The  burden  of  epilepsy  may   also  vary  depending  on  the  inclusion
of  single  unprovoked  seizures.  Although  the  International  League
Against  Epilepsy  (ILAE)  has  recently  included  single  unprovoked
seizures  in  the  deﬁnition  of  epilepsy  [4,5],  the  risk  of  recurrence  of
a  single  unprovoked  seizure  is  signiﬁcantly  lower  than  the  risk  of
recurrence  of  a  second  seizure  [6,7].

2.1.  Epilepsy  as  part  of  the  global  burden  of  disease

Historically,  health  policy  has  been  informed  by  mortality  statis-
tics.  Although  premature  mortality  has  been  an  important  source
for  the  understanding  of  clinical  conditions  leading  to  premature
mortality,  only  recently  the  focus  on  the  burden  of  diseases  has
been  moved  to  chronic  disabling  disorders.  Epilepsy  is  one  such
disease.  Chronic  neurological  disorders,  including  epilepsy,  account
for  a  signiﬁcant  proportion  of  the  world’s  disease  burden  [8].

The  Global  Burden  of  Disease  Study  is  a  comprehensive  analy-
sis  of  the  burden  of  291  diseases  and  injuries  and  67  risk  factors
in  187  countries  and  21  world  regions  comparing  the  years  1990,
2005  and  2010  [9].  In  this  comprehensive  review,  burden  estimates
were  obtained  from  all  available  epidemiological  data  using  pub-
lished  reports  and  statistical  methods  to  model  the  epidemiological
data  when  unavailable,  to  quantify  disability,  and  to  adjust  for
comorbidities.  The  burden  of  disease  was  measured  by  disability-
adjusted  life  years  (DALYs),  a  health  metric  capturing  the  years  lived
with  disability  (LDs),  the  non-fatal  component,  and  the  years  of  life
lost  (YLLs)  due  to  premature  mortality.  Mental,  neurological  and
substance  use  disorders  were  the  ﬁfth  cause  of  DALYs  and  the  lead-
ing  cause  of  YLDs  [10].  Neurological  disorders  accounted  for  3%  of
DALYs  and  5.6%  of  YLDs  [11].

As  with  other  diseases,  disability  weights  were  calculated  for
epilepsy  based  on  the  availability  of  treatments  and  the  presence
of  seizures  [8].  With  reference  to  published  reports  and  model-
ing,  a  total  of  28,300,000  prevalent  cases  are  expected  to  live
with  epilepsy  in  the  entire  world.  The  disease  ranks  fourth  after
tension-type  headache  (1,432,500,000),  migraine  (1,014,000),  and
Alzheimer  disease  (43,000,000).  The  DALYs  attributable  to  epilepsy
are  illustrated  in  Table  1.  Among  neurological  diseases,  epilepsy
accounts  for  the  highest  age-standardized  DALY  rates  both  in  men
and  in  women,  followed  by  migraine  and  Alzheimer  disease.  The
disease  accounts  for  0.7%  of  total  DALYs  and  for  6.8%  of  DALYs  due

mental,  neurological  and  substance  use  disorders.  A  16%  increase
of  DALYs  has  been  observed  both  in  men   and  in  women  when  com-
paring  the  years  1990  and  2010  (Table  1).  This  increase  was   largely
due  to  changes  in  population  growth  and  aging.

2.2.  Prevalence  of  epilepsy

The  prevalence  of  epilepsy  varies  substantially  between  devel-
oped  and  developing  countries. 
In  a  systematic  review  and
meta-analysis  of  published  reports,  the  median  lifetime  prevalence
for  developed  countries  was   5.8  per  1000  compared  to  15.4  per
1000  for  rural  and  10.3  per  1000  for  urban  studies  in  developing
countries  [12].  The  median  prevalence  of  active  epilepsy,  i.e.  hav-
ing  experienced  seizures  in  the  previous  ﬁve  years  and/or  being
treated,  was  4.9  per  1000  for  developed  countries  and  12.7  per
1000  and  5.9  per  1000  in  rural  and  urban  studies  in  developing
countries.  Along  with  sample  size  and  age  of  study  participants,
poor  health  care  and  lack  of  specialized  medical  personnel  and
diagnostic  equipment  can  explain  the  differences  between  devel-
oped  and  developing  countries  and  between  urban  and  rural  areas.
The  higher  lifetime  prevalence  of  epilepsy  in  developing  countries
can  be  also  due  to  higher  incidence  [13],  which  could  in  turn  be
attributable  to  traumatic  brain  injury  (TBI)  and  infectious  etiology,
particularly  in  rural  areas  [14,15].  Rural  areas  of  developing  coun-
tries  also  have  a  large  proportion  of  untreated  patients  possibly
due  to  stigma,  beliefs  and  attitudes  towards  epilepsy.  Furthermore,
recall  of  seizure  events  over  a  5-year  period  may   be  poorer  in  rural
areas  due  to  low  literacy  levels  and  may   lead  to  underestimation  of
prevalence  [16].

2.3.  Incidence  of  epilepsy

incidence  of  epilepsy 

The  estimated  median  worldwide 

is
50.4  per  100,000  population  per  year  [12].  However,  signiﬁcant
differences  can  be  found  when  comparing  developing  to  devel-
oped  countries  (incidence,  81.7  vs.  45.0).  The  differences  can  be
explained,  at  least  in  part,  by  the  level  of  income  in  the  country.
The  higher  incidence  of  TBI,  infections  and  infestations  of  the  CNS
in  developing  countries  contribute  to  the  increased  incidence  of
the  disease  [14,15].  Familial  clustering  and  differences  in  polymor-
phisms  between  developing  and  developed  countries  should  be
also  considered  [13].

The  incidence  of  epilepsy  varies  with  age  with  peaks  in  chil-
dren  under  one  year  and  predominantly  in  the  elderly  [17].  Annual
incidence  rates  as  high  as  180  per  100,000  population  in  patients
aged  85  years  or  older  have  been  calculated  [17].  The  increase
in  the  incidence  of  epilepsy  with  age  is  largely  explained  by  the
increased  incidence  of  common  clinical  conditions  in  the  elderly,
like  stroke  and  neurodegenerative  disorders  [18].  Silent  strokes
may  also  account  for  the  occurrence  of  unprovoked  seizures  and
epilepsy  in  this  age  group.  Even  acute  symptomatic  seizures  pre-
dominate  in  the  elderly  [19],  adding  to  the  burden  of  the  disease.
Thus,  with  the  increase  of  life  expectancy,  the  number  of  individuals
with  epilepsy  is  going  to  increase  in  the  future  [18].

2.4.  Prognosis  and  mortality  of  epilepsy

Epilepsy  is  a  self-remitting  clinical  condition  in  up  to  50%  of
cases  [20].  Seizure  remission  is  the  main  explanation  for  the  differ-
ence  between  lifetime  prevalence  and  incidence.  However,  when
incidence  and  lifetime  prevalence  are  compared  in  the  same  study,
other  factors  need  to  be  considered.  These  include  premature  mor-
tality,  socioeconomic  factors,  and  stigma  [1].

Epilepsy  carries  an  overall  increased  risk  of  premature  mortality.
However,  variable  estimates  have  been  provided  across  countries.
The  variability  in  such  estimates  can  be  attributed  principally  to

E.  Beghi  /  Pharmacological  Research  107  (2016)  79–84 

81

actual  differences  in  risk  of  premature  death  among  the  vari-
ous  populations  studied  and  to  differences  in  study  methods.  All
population-based  studies  reported  an  increased  risk  of  premature
mortality  among  people  with  epilepsy  compared  to  general  popula-
tions,  with  a  three-fold  pooled  standardized  mortality  ratio  (SMR),
i.e.  the  ratio  of  observed  deaths  in  epilepsy  to  that  expected  in  the
general  population  [21].  SMRs  are  especially  high  among  people
with  epilepsy  aged  less  than  50  years,  among  those  with  epilepsies
due  to  structural/metabolic  conditions,  with  generalized  tonic-
clonic  seizures,  and  seizures  not  remitting  under  treatment.  Among
deaths  directly  attributable  to  epilepsy  or  seizures,  important
immediate  causes  include  sudden  unexpected  death  in  epilepsy
(SUDEP),  status  epilepticus,  accidents,  drowning,  unintentional
injuries,  and  suicide.  SUDEP  is  the  most  common  cause  of  epilepsy-
related  deaths  and  individuals  with  epilepsy  have  27-fold  higher
rates  of  sudden  death  than  controls  [22].  In  a  pooled  analysis  of  pub-
lished  reports  [23],  an  overall  crude  annual  incidence  of  0.81  cases
and  an  overall  prevalence  of  7.1  per  100,000  of  SUDEP  was  esti-
mated.  Numbers  were  low  in  the  ﬁrst  decade  of  life,  were  highest
in  the  third  and  fourth  decades,  and  declined  markedly  in  the  sixth
decade.  Based  on  the  available  numbers,  in  2013  SUDEP  accounted
for  2750  deaths  in  the  united  States  and  3994  deaths  in  the  Euro-
pean  Union.

2.5.  The  burden  of  epilepsy  comorbidity

A  comorbid  condition  is  one  that  occurs  in  association  with  a
given  disease.  The  number  of  comorbidities  tends  to  increase  with
age  and  rises  to  six  in  individuals  aged  65  years  or  older  [24].  The
association  of  another  clinical  condition  with  epilepsy  has  substan-
tial  effects  on  morbidity  and  mortality,  quality  of  life,  demand  on
health  services  and,  consequently,  ﬁnancial  costs.  The  mechanisms
of  the  association  between  epilepsy  and  other  diseases  include
a  causal  association  and  shared  risk  factors,  each  represented  by
genetic  or  environmental  factors.  Several  population-based  stud-
ies,  some  of  them  using  administrative  databases,  have  addressed
the  comorbidity  of  epilepsy  consistently  showing  a  higher  preva-
lence  of  somatic  and  psychiatric  disorders  in  patients  with  epilepsy
than  in  people  without  epilepsy  (Table  2;  see  Ref.  [25]  for  review).
Psychiatric  symptoms  are  common  complaints  in  patients  with
epilepsy  and  the  majority  of  studies  using  a  control  group  report
increased  psychiatric  problems  in  epilepsy  cases  than  in  controls
[26].  The  immune  system  is  also  relevant  in  epilepsy,  as  shown  by
the  pathogenic  role  of  speciﬁc  antibodies  in  some  syndromes,  the
good  response  to  immune  therapies,  and  the  association  with  some
autoimmune  diseases  [27].  Asthma,  migraine  and  cerebral  tumors
tend  to  occur  more  frequently  in  younger  adults  while  cardiovas-
cular  disorders,  stroke,  dementia  and  meningioma  predominate  in
the  elderly  [28].  Compared  to  women  without  epilepsy,  women
with  epilepsy  are  at  increased  risk  of  spontaneous  miscarriage,
antepartum  or  post-partum  haemorrhage,  hypertension,  induc-
tion  of  labor,  caesarean  section,  preterm  birth,  and  fetal  growth
restriction  [29].  The  most  signiﬁcant  differences  in  the  frequency
of  comorbidity  between  epilepsy  and  controls  can  be  explained  by
a  causal  relationship.  This  is  particularly  true  for  stroke,  tumors,
dementia  and  Alzheimer  disease.  Other  associations  (gastrointesti-
nal  disorders,  cardiac  arrhythmia,  allergy  and  perhaps  endocrine
diseases)  can  be  explained  by  the  effects  of  antiepileptic  drugs.
Shared  risk  factors  may   be  implicated  in  the  association  between
epilepsy,  heart  disease,  diabetes,  and  asthma.  Epilepsy,  demen-
tia,  major  depression,  anxiety  and  migraine  may   reﬂect  underlying
bidirectional  mechanisms  but,  particularly  for  neurobehavioral  dis-
orders,  symptoms  reactive  to  the  negative  physical  and  social
effects  of  the  disease  and  its  treatment  cannot  be  excluded  [30].
A  comorbid  psychotic  illness  is  also  common,  with  peaks  in  tempo-
ral  lobe  epilepsy  [31].  Other  associations  cannot  be  easily  explained

COPD,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease.
The  identiﬁcation  and  the  prevention  of  several  risk  factors  involved  in  the  occur-
rence  of  seizures  can  signiﬁcantly  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  the  burden  of
epilepsy.

a Signiﬁcant  value.  Modiﬁed  from  Keezer  et  al.  [25].

but  the  possibility  exists  that  patients  with  epilepsy,  compared  to
the  rest  of  the  population,  tend  to  report  more  frequently  their  com-
plaints  or  undergo  more  intensive  investigations  of  their  health
problems.  The  presence  of  comorbidity  affects  mortality  in  peo-
ple  with  epilepsy.  About  two   thirds  of  premature  deaths  can  be
attributed  to  comorbidity  [32].

When  assessing  comorbidity  in  epilepsy,  the  presence  of  biolog-
ical  plausibility  does  not  conﬁrm  per  se  a  causal  relationship.  In  fact,
the  possibility  exists  that  epilepsy  occurs  spontaneously  even  at  the
presence  of  an  epileptogenic  CNS  injury.  For  example,  compared  to
the  general  population,  patients  with  severe  TBI  are  at  higher  risk
of  experiencing  unprovoked  seizures  only  during  the  ﬁrst  20  years
after  the  event  [33].  The  SMR   is  signiﬁcantly  increased  in  the  ﬁrst  15
years  in  patients  with  coexisting  cerebrovascular  disease,  but  only
after  20  years  of  follow-up  in  those  with  ischemic  heart  disease
[34].

2.6.  Antiepileptic  drugs  as  a  source  of  disease  burden

Antiepileptic  drugs  are  an  unreplaceable  resource  for  the  man-
agement  of  epilepsy.  However,  an  incorrect  use  of  antiepileptic
drugs  may   be  per  se  a  source  of  disease  burden.  This  issue  is
addressed  in  greater  detail  elsewhere  in  this  volume.  Sufﬁce  to
say  here  that  the  available  drugs  could  provoke  discomfort  and
even  put  the  patient  at  risk  of  serious  adverse  events  if  incor-
rectly  included  in  the  treatment  regimen  or  if  undue  attention
is  paid  to  the  side  effect  proﬁles  or  drug  interactions.  The  use  of
carbamazepine  in  patients  with  generalized  seizures,  valproate  in
women  of  childbearing  potential,  and  GABAergic  drugs  in  patients
with  depression  should  be  cautioned.  Patients  with  drug-resistant
epilepsy  are  at  high  risk  of  experiencing  adverse  treatment  events
because  of  the  drug  load  and  the  number  of  coprescribed  drugs
[35].  Children,  pregnant  women   and  the  elderly  are  the  categories
of  patients  in  which  an  incorrect  use  of  antiepileptic  drugs  may
be  a  source  of  adverse  events.  Antiepileptic  drugs  can  induce  both

anatomical,  cognitive  and  behavioral  teratogenicity,  with  variable
results  depending  on  the  designated  compound,  the  daily  dose  and
the  number  of  products  in  the  therapeutic  schedule  [36].

Quality  of  life  has  been  found  to  be  affected  to  a  greater  extent  by
adverse  treatment  effects  than  by  an  inadequate  control  of  seizures
[37].

  2461;  direct  non-medical, 

As  being  a  fairly  common  clinical  condition  affecting  all  ages
and  requiring  long-term  (sometimes  lifelong)  treatment,  epilepsy
carries  high  health  care  costs  for  the  society.  Included  are  direct
costs,  ie  the  expenditures  met   by  patients  and  caregivers  for  the
management  of  the  disease,  and  indirect  costs,  ie  the  costs  rep-
resented  by  productivity  losses.  While  direct  costs  can  be  fairly
easily  calculated,  indirect  costs  are  difﬁcult  to  measure  because
the  extent  of  productivity  losses  depends  on  a  number  of  vari-
ables,  including  the  welfare  state  and  the  individual’s  education
and  socio-economic  background.  In  2010,  the  total  cost  of  brain
disorders  in  Europe  was 
  798  billion,  of  which  direct  health  care
costs  were  37%,  direct  non-medical  costs  23%,  and  indirect  costs
40%  [38].  Average  cost  per  inhabitant  was 
  5.550  (ranging  from
D
  30,000  for  neuromuscular  disorders).  The
total  annual  cost  for  epilepsy  was  13.8  billion.  The  total  cost  per
patient  was 
  625;  indi-
D
rect, 
  2136).  Direct  costs  of  epilepsy  are  even  higher  in  the  United
States  where,  in  the  general  epilepsy  population,  total  healthcare
costs  per  person  ranged  from  $10,192  to  $47,862  and  epilepsy-
speciﬁc  costs  ranged  from  $1022  to  $19,749  [39].  Direct  costs  peak
in  the  ﬁrst  year  after  diagnosis  and  then  vary  according  to  the  sever-
ity  of  the  disease,  the  response  to  treatment,  and  the  presence
of  comorbidity  [40].  These  costs  are  highest  in  surgical  candi-
dates,  followed  by  patients  with  drug-resistant  epilepsy,  active
non  drug-resistant  epilepsy,  newly  diagnosed  epilepsy,  epilepsy
with  occasional  seizures,  and  epilepsy  in  remission  [41].  The  main
cost  drivers  include  hospital  admissions,  drugs  (mostly  second  and
third-generation  compounds),  surgery  and  vagal  nerve  stimulation.
The  economic  aspects  of  epilepsy  differ  with  the  age  of  the  affected
individuals  [42].  Differences  are  also  reﬂected  by  the  inclusion  of
incident  or  prevalent  epilepsy  populations.  Costs  also  vary  with
epileptic  syndromes,  antiepileptic  drugs,  hospital  admissions,  diag-
nostic  tests  and  referral  to  epilepsy  specialists  and  other  healthcare
professionals.  In  addition,  children  require  the  help  of  a  caregiver,
for  whom  lost  work  days  or  under-employment  are  frequent  occur-
rences.

D

Out-of-pocket  costs  may   also  represent  a  relevant  fraction  of  the
overall  costs,  especially  in  countries  where  the  public  management
of  health  care  is  suboptimal  or  non-existent.

2.8.  The  burden  of  epilepsy:  patients’  and  caregivers’  views

Epilepsy  strongly  affects  patients’  independence,  psychological
health  and  emotional  adjustment.  Educational  attainment,  driving
and  job  restrictions  and  stigma  may   have  strong  emotional  impact
and  signiﬁcant  effects  on  self-esteem,  relationships  with  peers  and
family  members,  and  even  personal  ﬁnances  [43].  The  social,  psy-
chological  and  emotional  consequences  of  the  disease  and  patients’
reported  outcomes  are  important  aspects  of  the  burden  of  epilepsy.
The  social  implications  of  epilepsy  have  been  assessed  in  a  large
European  cohort  study  comparing  individuals  with  epilepsy  to
non-epileptic  controls  in  Italy,  Germany,  Spain,  the  Netherlands,
England,  Portugal,  and  Russia  [44].  Patients  with  epilepsy  were
better  educated  than  controls.  However,  more  patients  than  con-
trols  were  single  or  unemployed  while  fewer  patients  than  controls
held  a  driver’s  license  or  practiced  sports.  The  distribution  of  social

variables  varied  across  countries  but,  with  few  exceptions,  the  dif-
ferences  between  patients  and  controls  were  fairly  similar.

Epilepsy  impairs  all  aspects  of  health-related  quality  of  life
(HRQOL).  The  burden  of  epilepsy  is  perceived  by  patients  and  care-
givers.  The  degree  of  parents’  concerns  and  the  severity  of  the
disease  correlate  with  deterioration  of  HRQOL  both  in  children  and
in  their  family  members  [45].  This  results  in  conﬂicts  within  the
family  and  affects  occupation,  leisure  activities,  peer  relationships
and  economy.  Parents  frequently  admit  increased  apprehensive-
ness,  even  when  not  justiﬁed  by  the  low  severity  of  the  disease.  As
with  children,  the  care  of  an  adult  with  epilepsy  has  a  profound  psy-
chosocial  impact  on  caregivers  [46].  Included  are  increased  levels
of  stress,  social  dissatisfaction,  individual  isolation,  worry,  help-
lessness,  depression,  marital  problems,  joblessness,  and  fear  during
seizures.

Awareness  and  attitudes  of  the  public  about  epilepsy  may   signif-
icantly  affect  the  burden  of  the  disease.  Knowledge  about  epilepsy,
its  clinical  features,  and  attitudes  towards  its  social/individual
implications  were  tested  in  a  nationwide  telephone  interview  in
Italy  [47].  Almost  all  respondents  declared  knowing  epilepsy,  56.6%
knew  a  person  with  epilepsy,  and  45.1%  saw  someone  seizing.  How-
ever,  only  50.4%  were  unaware  of  the  causes  of  the  disease,  56.1%
said  epilepsy  was   a  psychological/psychiatric  disease,  36.5%  a  form
of  insanity,  and  4.1%  even  an  evil  spirit  possession.  Epilepsy  was
incurable  according  to  35.5%.  Moderate-to-severe  restrictions  to
driving,  regular  employment,  military  career,  and  leisure  activi-
ties,  and  even  marriage  and  procreation  were  suggested  by  relevant
proportions  of  interviewees.  Knowledge  and  attitudes  varied  with
education,  age  and  gender.  These  ﬁndings  are  partly  in  keeping  with
other  worldwide  reports  [47]  and  may   justify  experienced  and  per-
ceived  stigma,  which  predominates  in  developing  countries  and
forces  people  with  epilepsy  to  conceal  their  disease  [48].  Patients’
and  caregiver  views  vary  when  comparing  children  and  adults  with
epilepsy.  The  former  may   experience  problems  at  school  and  when
facing  their  ﬁrst  emotional  and  social  activities  while  the  latter  may
have  difﬁculties  in  the  labor  market,  with  driving,  marriage  and
procreation.

2.9.  Unmet  needs  and  future  directions

is  common 

The  ﬁrst  and  foremost  action  to  reduce  the  burden  of  epilepsy
is  to  minimize  diagnostic  errors.  Misdiagnosis 
in
developing  countries  but  cannot  be  excluded  even  in  developed
countries.  Adequate  diagnostic  aids  and  educational  tools  should
be  made  available  in  developing  countries.  Efforts  should  be  made
to  improve  diagnostic  accuracy  in  patients  with  paroxysmal  events
by  devising  proper  algorithms  [49].  Well-deﬁned  clusters  of  symp-
toms  and  signs  differentiating  epileptic  seizures  from  PNES  are
awaited  to  favor  a  correct  diagnosis  in  the  absence  of  other  diag-
nostic  tests.  Misdiagnosis  should  not  only  be  intended  as  a  missed
diagnosis  of  epilepsy  but  also  as  an  erroneous  epilepsy  label  in
patients  experiencing  other  types  of  paroxysmal  events.  Misdiag-
nosis,  with  its  negative  reﬂections  (which  include  stigma,  unduly
exposure  to  a  chronic  drug  treatment,  and  “false”  drug-resistance),
will  perhaps  increase  after  the  adoption  of  the  new  deﬁnition  of
epilepsy,  issued  by  the  International  League,  which  may   simply
require  the  occurrence  of  a  single  unprovoked  seizure  in  patients
judged  at  high  risk  of  recurrence  [4,5].

The  use  of  incorrect  treatments  is  another  source  of  disease  bur-
den.  Another  substantial  action  for  the  reduction  of  the  burden  of
epilepsy  is  the  elimination  of  seizures.  Studies  done  in  untreated
individuals  from  developing  countries  have  shown  that  the  pro-
portion  of  epilepsies  entering  remission  is  similar  to  epilepsies  in
countries  in  which  virtually  all  patients  receive  appropriate  treat-
ment  [50,51].  As  treatment  gap  may   be  greater  than  75%  [52],  the
higher  prevalence  of  active  epilepsy  is  developing  countries  may

E.  Beghi  /  Pharmacological  Research  107  (2016)  79–84 

83

be  explained  at  least  in  part  by  undertreatment.  This  unmet  need
can  be  properly  addressed  and  perhaps  successfully  abated  by  pro-
viding  drugs  to  patients  living  in  developing  countries.

Another  effective  intervention  to  reduce  epilepsy  burden  is  the
prevention  of  symptomatic  epilepsies.  A  report  of  the  US  Institute
of  Medicine  emphasized  the  importance  of  the  early  identiﬁcation
of  comorbidities  [53].  Early  detection  may   lead  prevention  of  sev-
eral  complications  of  seizures  and  epilepsy,  including  antiepileptic
drugs,  with  important  reﬂections  on  quality  of  life  of  patients  and
caregivers,  and  on  economic  savings  for  the  health  systems.  The
treatment  of  comorbidities  can  also  have  effects  on  the  prevention
of  seizures.  Randomized  trials  of  antidepressant  drugs  showed  that
the  incidence  of  seizures  as  adverse  events  was  less  among  patients
receiving  active  treatment  as  compared  to  placebo  [54].

Although  in  developing  countries  the  proportion  of  people  liv-
ing  in  poverty  is  substantial,  social  deprivation  is  associated  with
risk  factors  for  epilepsy,  risk  for  developing  epilepsy,  and  increased
mortality  [1].  Low  socioeconomic  status  is  associated  with  an
increased  prevalence  of  epilepsy  in  Brazil  [55],  in  the  United  States
[56]  and  in  the  United  Kingdom  [57].  Low  socioeconomic  status  is
also  associated  with  stroke  [58],  TBI  [59],  congenital  malformations
[60],  CNS  infections  [61],  alcohol  abuse  [62],  brain  neoplasm  [63],
and  Alzheimer’s  disease  [64].  These  causes  of  epilepsy  are  also  asso-
ciated  with  an  increased  mortality  and  some  of  them  (stroke,  TBI,
CNS  infections,  alcoholism)  can  be  prevented.

The  increasing  life  expectancy  in  developing  countries  will  per-
haps  have  strong  effects  on  the  incidence  of  epilepsy  because  the
elderly  population  is  going  to  increase.  Early  detection  and  preven-
tion  of  epileptogenic  conditions  is  thus  mandatory  even  in  these
countries.

Epilepsy-related  mortality  remains  underappreciated  and  pub-
lic  health  interventions  are  inadequate  [65].  Despite  increasing
awareness  of  the  excess  mortality  faced  by  people  with  epilepsy,
epilepsy-related  deaths  cannot  be  accurately  estimated  nor  effec-
tively  reduced.  The  prevention  of  epilepsy-related  mortality  will
require  quantifying  epilepsy  deaths  in  the  community  and  mea-
suring  change  over  time.

Patient,  caregiver,  medical  student,  and  physician  education
about  SUDEP  remains  poor  [66,67].  A  collaborative  effort  is  needed
to  promote  awareness  and  education  about  epilepsy-related  mor-
tality  and  to  develop,  evaluate,  and  implement  effective  preventive
measures.

The  attribution  of  costs  to  epilepsy  is  difﬁcult  to  disentangle
from  the  cost  of  the  underlying  epileptogenic  conditions  [68].  For
each  clinical  condition  with  epileptogenic  potential  well-designed
prospective  studies  are  needed  comparing  patients  with  and  with-
out  seizures  and  followed  for  prolonged  periods  of  time  are
awaited.

In  countries  with  limited  resources,  the  economic  burden  on
households  may   be  unsustainable,  leading  to  undertreatment  or
even  treatment  discontinuation.  Further  research  is  needed  to
explore  the  burden  of  out-of-pocket  costs,  mostly  in  developing
countries  but  even  in  countries  where  universal  coverage  arrange-
ments  are  in  place.

Caregiver  burden  constitutes  an  unmet  need.  Positive  fam-
ily  support  is  needed  for  children  and  adults  with  epilepsy.  This
includes  developing  effective  educational  materials  suited  to  indi-
vidual  family  members,  encouraging  the  use  of  support  groups,  and
offering  psychotherapy  to  family  members.

3.  Conclusions

Epilepsy  is  a  chronic  disease  with  differing  phenotypes  and  rel-
evant  physical,  psychological,  emotional  and  social  implications  for
the  affected  individuals  and  their  families  and  caregivers.  All  these

factors  add  to  the  burden  of  the  disease.  However,  many  of  the
factors  implicated  in  the  onset  of  epilepsy,  its  course  and  treat-
ment  can  be  favorably  addressed  with  appropriate  strategic  plans.
More  research  is  needed  to  investigate  and  manage  the  medical
and  psychosocial  implications  of  epilepsy.  Epilepsy  priorities  have
been  outlined  in  a  recent  report  by  the  ILAE-IBE  Epilepsy  Advocacy
Europe  Task  Force  [69].  In  that  document,  suggestions  were  made
to  develop  speciﬁc  research  programs  focusing  on  pediatric  and
aging  populations  and  on  comorbidities  and  to  reduce  stigma  and
social  burden  through  targeted  initiatives  at  national  and  regional
levels.  Identiﬁed  priorities  also  include,  among  others,  therapeutic
strategies  aimed  at  improving  prevention  and  cure  of  epilepsy.
