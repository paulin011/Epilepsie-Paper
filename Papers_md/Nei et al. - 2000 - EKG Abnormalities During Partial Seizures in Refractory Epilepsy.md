Summary:  Purpose:  This  study  assessed  the  frequency  and 
character of  ictal cardiac rhythm and conduction  abnormalities 
in  intractable  epilepsy.  Sudden  unexpected  death  in  epilepsy 
(SUDEP) is  a  major  cause of  excess  mortality  in  people  with 
refractory  epilepsy,  and  cardiac  arrhythmias  during  seizures 
may  be  responsible.  The  frequency  of  cardiac  abnormalities 
during  seizures  in  patients  with  refractory  epilepsy  must  be 
determined. 

Methods:  Fifty-one  seizures  in  43  patients  with  intractable 
partial  epilepsy were analyzed  prospectively  from CCTV-EEG 
monitoring with one ECG channel. Arrhythmias, repolarization 
abnormalities, and PR  and  QT,  intervals  were  determined  for 
preictal  (3 min), ictal, and postictal  (3 min) periods  for one or 
more  seizures per  patient.  Parametric  statistics  were  used  for 
continuous  variables,  and  nonparametric  statistics  were  used 
for categoric variables. 

Results: Of  the patients,  39% had one or more abnormalities 

of  rhythm  and/or  repolarization  during  or  immediately  after 
seizures. Abnormalities  included  asystole  (one),  atrial  fibrilla- 
tion  (one),  marked  or  moderate  sinus  arrhythmia  (six),  supra- 
ventricular  tachycardia  (one),  atrial  premature  depolarizations 
(APDs;  eight),  ventricular  premature  depolarizations  (VPDs; 
two),  and bundle-branch  block  (three). Mean  seizure duration 
was longer in patients with abnormalities  than in those without 
(204 vs.  71  s;  p  < 0.001).  Generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures 
were  also  associated  with  increased  occurrence  of  ictal  ECG 
abnormalities  (p  = 0.006) as compared  with  complex  partial 
seizures.  There  were  no  clinically  significant  differences  in 
mean preictal  and  ictal/postictal  PR  and  QT,  intervals. 

Conclusions:  Cardiac rhythm  and  conduction  abnormalities 
are common during  seizures, particularly  if  they are prolonged 
or  generalized,  in  intractable  epilepsy.  These  abnormalities 
may contribute to SUDEP. Key Words: Epilepsy-SUDEP- 
ECG-Cardiac-Arrhythmia. 

Seizures may  directly  affect cardiac rate  and rhythm. 
They  commonly  produce  sinus  tachycardia  and  occa- 
sionally may cause sinus bradycardia, asystole, and other 
rhythm disturbances (1-7).  However, serious cardiac ar- 
rhythmias during seizures appear to be rare (1,s).  Studies 
have focused on cardiac arrhythmias associated with sei- 
zures largely because of their possible relation  to sudden 
unexpected  death in  epilepsy  (SUDEP). 

People  with  epilepsy  have  an  increased  risk  of  death 
compared  with  the  general  population  (9). SUDEP is  a 
major  cause  of  mortality  in  patients  with  epilepsy, par- 
ticularly  in  those  with  refractory  epilepsy  (10,11). 
SUDEP may  account  for perhaps  half  of  the  deaths  in 
this  population  (12,13). A  variety  of  factors  have been

associated with SUDEP, including uncontrolled seizures, 
young  age,  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures,  seizures 
during sleep, poor antiepileptic medication  (AED) com- 
pliance,  and  use  of  a  larger  number  of  AEDs  (14-18). 
However, the major risk factor appears to be having sei- 
zures. People who are not  completely  controlled have a 
much higher risk of  SUDEP than do well-controlled pa- 
tients  (16). 

Both  pulmonary  and  cardiac  mechanisms  have been 
implicated  as  possible  contributors  to  SUDEP ( 1 1,19- 
21). Animal  models  reveal  that  significant hypoventila- 
tion  can occur during prolonged  seizures and  may  con- 
tribute to seizure-associated deaths (1 1,22,23). Thus far, 
ictal  cardiac  rhythm  disturbances  have  been  primarily 
reported  as case reports or in  series of  epilepsy patients 
focusing  on  heart-rate  changes  during  seizures.  How- 
ever, no  studies have been  performed  to determine how 
frequently abnormalities of cardiac rhythm and conduc- 
high 
risk for SUDEP, such as those  with  refractory epilepsy. 

Occur  during seizures in patients at a

Additionally,  it  is  not  known  whether  specific  seizure 
characteristics,  such as seizure type, duration, and  later- 
ality, influence  the risk for ictal cardiac arrhythmias. 

The goals  of  this  study  were  to  evaluate  the cerebral 
mechanisms  involved with ictal cardiac arrhythmias, de- 
termine  how  frequently  ictal  cardiac  arrhythmias  are 
seen  in  patients  with  refractory  epilepsy,  and  assess 
whether the risk factors associated with SUDEP correlate 
with a higher likelihood of occurrence of  an ictal cardiac 
rhythm disturbance. The identification of specific cardiac 
abnormalities associated  with  seizures may  reveal  a po- 
tential mechanism of death in some patients with SUDEP 
and  may  eventually  aid in  the prevention  of  SUDEP. 

METHODS 

Subjects 

Forty-three  patients  with  refractory  partial  epilepsy 
who were consecutively admitted to a video-EEG moni- 
toring  unit  as part  of  their  evaluations  for epilepsy  sur- 
gery  were  studied  prospectively  between  August  1997 
and April  1998. AEDs were tapered as needed to record 
seizures. No patients had  a history  of  cardiac or pulmo- 
nary disease, and all had normal serum potassium, mag- 
nesium,  and  calcium  levels  on  admission. 

ECG data 

Each  patient had  a  12-lead ECG performed  at admis- 
sion.  In  addition,  ECG  data from  at  least  one complex 
partial  or  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizure  per  patient 
was  analyzed.  ECG data were  obtained  from lead  I  re- 
cording during video-EEG monitoring by using the Tele- 
factor  Corporation  (Conshohoken,  PA,  U.S.A.)  TWIN 
program.  ECG  data  from  each  seizure  were  analyzed 
separately  for  the  following  three  periods:  (a)  preictal 
period:  3  min  immediately  preceding  seizure  onset;  (b) 
ictal period: during the entire ictal period, limited to tech- 
nically  satisfactory  portions  of  the  recording;  and  (c) 
postictal  period:  3 min  immediately  after seizure cessa- 
tion. 

The following data were collected for each of the three 

periods: 

1. 

2. 

Heart rate:  Heart rate  was  the number of  consecu- 
tive  RR  intervals  during  the  first  minute  of  each 
period. 
Rhythm abnormalities: These included moderate or 
marked  sinus  arrhythmia  (defined  as  250%  in- 
crease in heart rate during inspiration as compared 
with  expiration)  (24),  APDs  (atrial  premature  de- 
polarizations),  VPDs  (ventricular premature  depo- 
larizations),  atrial  fibrillation, junctional  escape 
complexes, asystole, and supraventricular tachycar- 
dia. Blocked APDs were defined as APDs that did 
not  conduct  to  the ventricles. 

Conduction  abnormalities  included  bundle-branch 
block. 
Repolarization abnormalities included  ST-segment 
elevation or depression and T-wave inversion.  ST- 
segment changes  were  measured in millivolts,  and 
then  converted  to  the equivalent  number  of  milli- 
meters,  as  measured  on  standard  12-lead ECGs. 
PR  and  corrected  QT  (QT,)  measurements  were 
measured  by  using  digital  calipers  every  20-30  s 
during the baseline and postictal periods, and every 
10 s  during the ictal period,  as allowed by  record- 
ing  artifact  and  ictal  duration;  for  a  total  of  five 
measurements per period when possible. Data were 
not  used  for  this  analysis  if  five  measurements 
could not be reliably made during a specific period. 
The QT,  was determined by QT/square root of the 
RR  interval  for each  QT  value  (25).  PR  intervals 
were  considered normal  between  120 and  200 ms. 
QT,  intervals were considered normal at <440 ms. 

Comparison variables 

EEG  was  obtained  by  using  the  10-20  system  and 
sphenoidal  electrode  placement.  Variables  consisted  of 
(a)  laterality  of  seizure  onset,  as  determined  by  scalp 
EEG data, or as determined subsequently by intracranial 
subdural and depth electrode EEG data; (b) state of con- 
sciousness  (awake  or  asleep)  before  seizure  onset;  (c) 
seizure duration, as determined by clinical and EEG data; 
(d) seizure type:  complex partial  or secondarily general- 
ized  tonic-clonic;  and  (e) AEDs  on  admission. 

Data analysis 

ECGs were classified as abnormal if any abnormalities 
of  rhythm  or conduction  were  found  during  any period 
that  were  not  present  on  the  baseline  12-lead ECG; all 
other  ECGs  were  classified  as  normal.  Isolated  sinus 
tachycardia (heart rate  h 100 beatdmin) was not consid- 
ered an  abnormality  and  was  analyzed  separately. 

For each seizure, ECGs were classified  as abnormal if 
a  previously  mentioned  abnormality  was  found  in  the 
ictal  or postictal  state. The presence of ECG abnormali- 
ties  was  assessed  in  relation  to each  of  the comparison 
variables.  Parametric  and  nonparametric  statistics  were 
used  as  appropriate and  are specified in  the Results. 

RESULTS 

Fifty-one  seizures  from  43  patients  with  intractable 
partial  epilepsy  were  analyzed  for this  study. The mean 
age was 34 years (range,  14-55  years), with 25 men and 
18 women.  There  were  35  complex  partial  and  16 sec- 
ondarily  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures.  The  mean 
seizure  duration  was  123 s  (standard  error,  23;  range, 
11-960).

Some patients had >1 abnormality. See text and Table 2 for details. 

Preictal  ECG:  Preictal  ECG  was  normal  in  40  patients 
and abnormal in three patients. Each of these three had 
intermittent APDs. 

Ictal  and  postictal  ECG:  Seventeen  (39%)  patients  had 
ECG  abnormalities  during  the  ictal  and/or  postictal 
period  (see Tables  1 and  2). Twenty-three (53%) pa- 
tients  had  sinus  tachycardia  (heart  rate  2100 beats/ 
min) during the ictal or postictal period, of  whom  10 
had ECG  abnormalities. Thus a total of  30 (70%) pa- 
tients  had  at  least  one  ECG  abnormality  or  sinus 
tachycardia during the ictal and/or postictal period. 
The  most  common 'abnormalities were  the  presence  of 
APDs  (eight  patients)  and  sinus  arrhythmia  (six  pa- 
tients; (Fig.  l). Three of  the eight patients with APDs 

also  had  APDs  during  the  preictal  period;  however, 
APDs markedly increased in frequency during the ic- 
tal  and/or  postictal  periods.  Six  patients  had  poten- 
tially  serious ECG  abnormalities  (ST-segment eleva- 
tion, junctional escape, asystole, atrial fibrillation, and 
supraventricular tachycardia), at times in combination 
with more benign abnormalities. The other 11 patients 
had generally benign abnormalities (APDs, marked or 
moderate  sinus  arrhythmia,  bundle-branch  block, 
VPDs,  and  atrial  couplets/triplets).  Several  patients 
had  more than  one abnormality (Table 2). 

When abnormalities occurred during the postictal period, 
they were often noted to persist throughout the entire 
3-min  period,  and  noted  to  persist  for  several  more 
minutes in  some cases. 

Baseline 12-lead ECG 

Fifteen (35%) patients had  one or more abnormalities 
noted  on  a baseline  12-lead ECG.  Twelve  of  these  pa- 
tients  (T-wave  abnormalities  in  five,  bundle-branch 
block in two, left atrial enlargement in two, left ventricu- 
lar hypertrophy in one, first-degree atrioventricular block 
in  one, and  infarct pattern in two)  had  normal ictal and 
postictal ECGs,  and  three of  these  patients  (incomplete 
bundle-branch block and  infarct pattern in  one, T-wave 
inversion  in  one,  and  incomplete  right  bundle-branch 
block in one) had  abnormal ictal or postictal ECGs. Pa- 
tients with significant abnormalities on the 12-lead ECG, 
except for one patient who was lost to follow-up, under- 
went  further  evaluation,  and  none  was  found  to  have 
evidence  of  coronary  artery  disease,  evidence  of  myo- 
cardial injury by noninvasive studies, or other active car- 
diac disease requiring intervention.

M. NEI  ET AL. 

For  patients  with  ictal  or  postictal  abnormalities,  13 
(75%)  had  normal  12-lead  baseline  ECGs,  and  four 
(25%) had  abnormal ECGs. For patients without abnor- 
malities,  14 (55%) had normal ECGs, and  12 (45%) had 
abnormal ECGs. Patients with ictal or postictal ECG ab- 
normalities  were  not  more  likely  to  have  abnormalities 
on  a  12-lead ECG  (p  = 0.12, Fisher’s  Exact test) than 
were patients with normal baseline ECGs. 

Seizure duration and type 

Seizures  associated  with  ECG  abnormalities  lasted 
longer than  those  without  (204 vs.  71  s; t  = 3.68; p  < 
0.00 1 ).  Generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  were  also 
more frequently associated with ictal ECG abnormalities 
(x2 = 5.3; p  = 0.02) as compared with complex partial 
seizures. Using stepwise discriminant function analysis, 
generalized tonic-clonic  seizure type and longer seizure 
duration were each found to be independent predictors of 
ECG abnormalities (Wilks’ A  = 0.778; F(2, 48)  = 6.8; 
p < 0.002). 

Additionally,  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  were 
also more likely to be associated with sinus tachycardia 
than were complex partial  seizures (p  = 0.035; Fisher’s 
Exact test). 

State of consciousness before seizure onset 

The state before seizure onset did not influence wheth- 
er or not ictal or postictal ECG abnormalities were pre- 
sent.  For  20  seizures  with  ECG  abnormalities,  eight 
(40%) were awake, and 12 (60%) were in non-rapid  eye 
movement  (NREM)  sleep  before  seizure  onset. For  31 
seizures  without  ECG  abnormalities,  19  (61 %)  were 
awake, and 12 (39%) were in NREM sleep. There was no 
significant  difference  between  the  two  groups  (x2 = 
2.21; p  = 0,137). 

Laterality of seizure onset 

Side  of  seizure  onset  was  not  related  to  presence  or 
absence of  ictal ECG abnormalities for the 33 seizures in 
which  the  side of  seizure onset could be reliably deter- 
mined (p  = 0.35; Fisher’s Exact test). For seizures with 
ECG abnormalities, eight (73%) began in the right hemi- 
sphere, and  three (27%) in  the left hemisphere. For  sei- 
zures without ECG abnormalities, I3 (59%) began in the 
right hemisphere, and nine (41%) began in the left hemi- 
sphere. 

Anticonvulsant medications 

Patients with ictal or postictal ECG abnormalities took 
similar medications as those without abnormalities: phe- 
nytoin  (PHT; 35%  vs.  35%), valproic  acid  (VPA;  12% 
vs.  19%),  carbamazepine  (CBZ;  29%  vs.  42%),  la- 
motrigine (LTG; 18% vs.  19%), gabapentin (GBP; 18% 
vs.  1 l%), topiramate (TPM; 35% vs. 27%), phenobarbi- 
tal  (PB;  12%  vs.  15%), and  tranxene  (12%  vs.  4%). 
Additionally,  one  (4%)  patient  without  abnormalities 
was taking  felbamate (FBM). 

Epilepsiu, Vol. 41, No.  S, 2000 

The mean  number of  AEDs per patient at the time of 
admission was the same, I .8 medications per patient, for 
patients with  or without  ictal ECG  abnormalities. 

PR  and  QT,  intervals 

We calculated mean values for preictal, ictal, and post- 
ictal PR and QT,  intervals for each patient. All mean PR 
and  QT,  values  were  normal.  Mean  values  were  then 
averaged for each of  the three periods for the patients as 
a whole. 

With paired t tests, there were no differences between 
preictal and  ictal PR  intervals. Similarly, there  were no 
differences  between  preictal  and  ictal  or  postictal  QT, 
intervals.  There  was  a  significant  difference  between 
preictal  (147  ms)  and  postictal  (141  ms)  PR  intervals 
( t   =  2.23;  p  =  0.003),  which  is  consistent  with  the 
general tendency toward  increased heart rate  during the 
postictal period  as compared with  the preictal period. 

Patients with  two  seizures 

Eight  patients  had  two  seizures  reviewed.  Two  pa- 
tients  had  one seizure with  ECG  abnormalities and  an- 
other seizure without abnormalities. In both patients, the 
ECG abnormalities were seen during the  longer seizure. 
Patient  1 had  two  complex  partial  seizures,  one  of 
which lasted  110 s,  and the other, 960 s.  After the 960-s 
seizure, he  developed a bundle-branch block during the 
postictal period. 

Patient 42 had two complex partial seizures (1 10 and 
720 s), with ST-segment elevation occurring  during the 
longer seizure. 

In all other patients, both seizures had similar findings 
[i.e.,  both  ECGs  were  abnormal  or  both  were  normal 
(Table 2)]. 

DISCUSSION 

The major finding in this study is that cardiac rhythm 
and conduction abnormalities occur frequently during or 
after  partial  seizures  in  patients  with  refractory  partial 
epilepsy. In particular, ECG findings consistent with ex- 
cessive autonomic discharge, including atrial fibrillation, 
APDs, VPDs, supraventricular tachycardias, sinus tachy- 
cardia, and asystole, were common. The primary features 
associated with the appearance of ECG abnormalities are 
prolonged seizure duration and  the presence  of  second- 
arily  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures.  Other  factors 
studied, state of  consciousness before seizure onset, lat- 
erality of  seizure onset, type and  number of  AEDs,  and 
abnormal baseline  12-lead ECG, were not related to the 
presence of  ictal or postictal ECG abnormalities. 

Both generalized seizures and longer seizure duration 
may  increase  the  risk  for  cardiac  arrhythmias  through 
ictal autonomic hyperactivity. Such changes may be due

seizure  duration  and  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures 
may  involve  greater  ictal  spread  than  complex  partial 
seizures and thus may be more likely to affect autonomic 
centers responsible  for cardiac control, although a com- 
plex partial  seizure spreading to autonomic centers could 
also produce  similar ECG abnormalities. 

Serial  seizures  may  produce  additive  autonomic  ef- 
fects, particularly  because  cardiac rhythm  abnormalities 
often persisted throughout  the entire  3-min postictal pe- 
riod.  Such  a  mechanism  may  explain why  both  the fre- 
quency  of  VPDs  and  heart  rate  increased  significantly 
during  the  second  seizure  as  compared  with  the  first 
seizure  in patient  13. This study did not  specifically re- 
view how  long the cardiac  abnormalities persisted  post- 
ictally because  the postictal  study period  was  limited  to 
3 min. Recently Tigaran and Dam (27) reported a patient 
with postictal atrial fibrillation persisting  for hours. This 
requires  further  study,  because  late-occurring  arrhyth- 
mias  may  have  clinical  consequences. 

Generalized seizures have been associated with higher 
risk  for SUDEP and  in  this  study  have  been  associated 
with cardiac arrhythmias,  suggesting the possibility  of  a 
cause-and-effect  relation  between  ictal  cardiac  arrhyth- 
mias  and  SUDEP. The  high  frequency  of  ictal  cardiac 
rhythm  abnormalities  in  this  group  of  patients, who are 
generally  at  higher  risk  for  SUDEP, also  supports  this 
possible  relation. 

Seizures could result in lethal arrhythmias by two ma- 
jor mechanisms. Autonomic activity associated with  sei- 
zures  might  directly  cause  lethal  arrhythmias.  Six  pa- 
tients in this study had potentially serious abnormalities, 
suggesting that seizures might rarely  result in lethal car- 
diac rhythms. Additionally, in this study, ictal autonomic 
stimulation  was  seen  in  the  majority  of  patients.  It  is 
possible that repetitive autonomic stimulation from mul- 
tiple  seizures  may  damage  the  heart,  resulting  in  myo- 
cardial fibrosis and myofibrillar degeneration, lesions as- 
sociated with catecholamine toxicity (28,29), which have 
also been  identified  in  SUDEP patients  ( 1  4,30).  An  ab- 
normal  cardiac  substrate  (myofibrillar degeneration and 
fibrosis) in the setting of  a trigger  (autonomic discharge 
associated with  seizures) may result in lethal ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias.  Myocardial  fibrosis  with  autonomic 
imbalance has been proposed as a mechanism of  postin- 
farction ventricular tachycardia (3 1). Similarly, a seizure 
may  have triggered  a lethal arrhythmia in the  setting of 
prior myocardial infarctions in three SUDEP patients re- 
ported  by  Dasheiff  and  Dickinson  (32).  Once  patients 
develop  myocardial  fibrosis  through  repeated  seizures, 
they may then remain at increased risk for lethal arrhyth- 
mias, even if  there are only rare isolated seizures. How- 
ever, this  remains  speculative. 

Prior  studies  have reported  ST-segment  and  T-wave 
changes associated with epilepsy in humans and animals 
(33,34).  ST-segment  elevation  was  also  found  in  three 

study  patients.  This  finding  suggests  that  myocardial 
ischemia  might  also  occur  in  association with  seizures. 
However,  at this  time,  the  mechanism  underlying  these 
changes  is  unknown,  and  thus  it  is  difficult  to  make 
conclusions regarding their potential  clinical relevance. 
CBZ  was  used  more  frequently  than  other  AEDs  in 
one series of  SUDEP patients  (35), and prolongation  of 
the  QT  interval  was  postulated  as  one  mechanism  by 
which CBZ might cause lethal arrhythmias. In this study, 
no  specific medication  was  associated  with  the appear- 
ance  of  ECG  abnormalities. Additionally,  although  this 
study  did  not  analyze  whether  specific  AEDs  may  be 
associated with  longer  QT,  intervals, the  mean  QT,  in- 
tervals were normal in all cases. There was no evidence 
that  any  specific  AED  causes  an  abnormal  QT,  either 
interictally  or in association with  seizures. 

Some  comments  should  be  made  regarding  the  pa- 
tients with  abnormal  12-lead ECGs. As described in the 
Results  sections,  these  patients  (except  one)  underwent 
extensive noninvasive cardiac testing, which revealed no 
evidence  of  past  or  present  cardiac  disease.  This  study 
reveals  no  association  between  ictal  or  postictal  ECG 
abnormalities and abnormal  12-lead ECGs. Thus signifi- 
cant  cardiac  disease  cannot  explain  the  seizure- 
associated  ECG  changes  seen  in  this  study,  although 
more subtle cardiac changes, such as myofibrillar degen- 
eration, cannot be  excluded. 

Regarding  study  limitations,  PR  and  QT,  intervals 
were not analyzed for individual patients because of  the 
relatively  small number  of  data  points  obtained  per  pe- 
riod  of  study for each patient. Also because each EEG- 
ECG review was a lengthy process, we limited the num- 
ber  of  seizures  per  patient  to  one or  two  to  review  as 
many  patients  as  possible.  Likewise,  the  control  data 
were  limited  to  3  min  of  preictal  recording  for  similar 
reasons  and  were  obtained  from the  immediate preictal 
period  in  an attempt to try  to control for influences that 
might  arise  from  differences  in  time  of  day,  state,  and 
level of physical activity. Data from several seizures per 
patient  may  reveal patterns  of  ECG changes,  which  are 
stereotyped for each patient  and  related  to  specific pat- 
terns  of  ictal  spread.  Physical  activity  during  the  sei- 
zures,  particularly  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures, 
may also have some influence on the ECG. Further study 
evaluating  the effect  of  physical  activity on the ECG in 
patients  with  epilepsy  may  help to  clarify this  further. 

Additional work in this area is needed to explore more 
closely the relation between seizures and cardiac rhythm. 
ECG  monitoring  should  be  done  routinely  in  patients 
admitted  for  video-EEG  monitoring  to  identify  serious 
ictal cardiac abnormalities, particularly in those with re- 
fractory epilepsy. Patients with ictal cardiac arrhythmias 
may benefit from further cardiac evaluation for a serious 
underlying  cardiac substrate, which may  elevate the pa- 
tient’s risk of lethal arrhythmia during a seizure. As more

of  ictal cardiac abnormalities and their possible relation 
to  SUDEP may be eventually elucidated.
