Summary: Purpose: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
(SUDEP) is a major cause of mortality for patients with epilepsy.
Cardiac factors may be involved and were evaluated in this study.
Methods: EEG and ECG data for 21 patients with definite
(n = 6) or probable (n = 15) SUDEP were compared with data
from a group of 43 patients with refractory partial epilepsy. ECG
abnormalities and heart rate (HR) changes were correlated with
clinical data.

Results: Fourteen patients died in their sleep; two were awake.
Ictal maximal HR (90 seizures from 16 of 21 patients) was
significantly higher in SUDEP (mean, 149 beats/min, BPM)
than in comparison patients (mean, 126 BPM; p < 0.001).
Greater increases in HR were associated with seizures arising
from sleep (78 BPM increase) than from wakefulness (47 BPM;

p < 0.001) in SUDEP, as compared with the non-SUDEP group
(52 BPM in sleep, 43 BPM in wakefulness; p = 0.27). Ic-
tal cardiac repolarization and rhythm abnormalities occurred in
56% of SUDEP (including two atrial fibrillation, two ventricu-
lar premature depolarizations, two marked sinus arrhythmia, two
atrial premature depolarizations, one junctional escape, one ST-
segment elevation), and 39% of comparison patients (p = 0.39).
No specific seizure onset (laterality or lobe) was associated with
SUDEP.

Conclusions: This study reveals, for the first time, evidence
of increased autonomic stimulation (as measured by HR) associ-
ated with seizures, particularly in sleep, in patients with SUDEP,
as compared with a clinically similar group of patients with re-
fractory epilepsy. Key Words: SUDEP—EEG—ECG.

Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a
major cause of mortality in patients with epilepsy (1–
4). Although SUDEP has been associated with general-
ized tonic–clonic (GTC) seizures, young adult age, men-
tal retardation, low antiepileptic drug (AED) levels, use
of multiple AEDs, and refractory epilepsy (5–12), no spe-
cific data can identify which patients are at greatest risk
for SUDEP. Therefore targeted prophylactic interventions
cannot be implemented.

The etiology for SUDEP remains elusive and may be
multifactorial. Both cardiac rate and rhythm disturbances
and respiratory-pattern abnormalities have been identified
during seizures (13–25). Cardiopulmonary autonomic ab-
normalities have also been identified interictally in pa-
tients with epilepsy (26). However, whereas autonomic de-
rangements have been identified in patients with epilepsy,
they have not been identified in actual victims of SUDEP.
Studies on SUDEP have evaluated historical data regard-

ing cardiac and pulmonary status, including interictal 12-
lead ECG data, but no specific abnormalities have been
identified. Many SUDEP victims are found in bed (6,19),
suggesting that the risk for specific etiologic mechanisms
directly responsible for death may increase during sleep.
Nonetheless, strong evidence implicates seizures as being
directly responsible for SUDEP. Seizures have been noted
shortly before death in many people with SUDEP, sug-
gesting that seizures and their resulting systemic effects
have a direct role in causing death. Additionally, surgi-
cal series (27,28) report that mortality due to SUDEP de-
clines when epilepsy surgery is successful in eliminating
seizures, also supporting an etiologic role of seizures in
SUDEP.

No detailed analyses are found in the medical litera-
ture regarding the ictal EEG and ECG from patients who
subsequently died with a diagnosis of SUDEP. This study
examines these data and whether specific clinical features
such as location or laterality of the epileptogenic zone,
timing of seizures, or patterns of seizure activity are re-
lated to SUDEP. Identification of any such abnormalities
before death may help to elucidate the etiology of SUDEP,
aid in identification of those at greatest risk, and lead to
strategies for its prevention.

EEG AND ECG IN SUDEP

339

METHODS

Definitions

Definite SUDEP was defined as sudden death in a pa-
tient with a confirmed history of epilepsy, who was oth-
erwise in good health, whose death remains unexplained
after autopsy. Probable SUDEP was defined as sudden
death with all the same criteria as for definite SUDEP,
except that autopsy evidence is unavailable.

Subjects

Twenty-one subjects with definite (n = 6) or probable
(n = 15) SUDEP who had undergone video-EEG monitor-
ing for epilepsy between 1990 and 1999 were identified at
three tertiary care epilepsy centers (Jefferson Comprehen-
sive Epilepsy Center, Philadelphia, PA; Vanderbilt Univer-
sity Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, Boston, MA).

For comparison, interictal and ictal ECG data from 43
consecutive subjects with refractory partial seizures were
analyzed for heart rate and rhythm. Details regarding this
population are available in a previous article (20). These
patients were evaluated in a previous study, and at the
time of reevaluation in February 2003, none subsequently
had SUDEP since data collection in 1997 and 1998. Raw
data obtained prospectively for that study were reanalyzed
for the current study as described later. Only GTC and
complex partial seizures were evaluated from this group.

Data

All available inpatient and outpatient EEG and ECG
data for each subject were reviewed. At least one seizure
per patient in the comparison group was analyzed. EEG
data were obtained by using the international standard 10–
20 system electrode placement and sphenoidal or anterior
temporal electrodes with one lead of ECG monitoring.
Continuous video-EEG data were obtained by using com-
mercially available equipment.

Video-EEG data evaluated for each recorded seizure are
(a) location of ictal onset zone, (b) seizure duration, (c)
seizure type, (d) location of interictal epileptiform abnor-
malities, (e) presence or absence of seizure clusters, and
(f) state (wakefulness or sleep) during which the seizure
arose.

Continuous ECG data recorded simultaneously with the
video-EEG data (available for 16 of 21 SUDEP patients)
were reviewed for (a) any repolarization or rhythm abnor-
mality (any rhythm other than sinus rhythm) occurring in-
terictally, during seizures, or postictally; (b) preictal heart
rate (averaged over a 20-s baseline 1 min before seizure
onset); and (c) maximal heart rate during each seizure
(determined from the shortest RR interval). Marked sinus
arrhythmia was defined as a ≥50% change in the RR in-
terval. Abnormalities were correlated with specific factors
noted during monitoring: (a) seizure clusters, (b) specific
seizure types, and (c) state (wakefulness or sleep) dur-
ing which seizures arose. All ECG data were reviewed

by a board-certified cardiologist and electrophysiologist
(R.H.). All available interictal (during wakefulness and
sleep) and ictal ECG data were reviewed. AEDs were ta-
pered in a similar fashion, as needed, in both control and
SUDEP patients during video-EEG monitoring.

Additional data for each patient were obtained from
review of the medical records: (a) autopsy data, (b) time
and circumstances of death, (c) history of seizure clusters,
(d) timing of seizures (wakefulness or sleep), (e) comorbid
medical problems, (f) all medications at the time of death,
(g) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, (h)
seizure frequency before death, (i) seizure types, and (j)
type and outcome of epilepsy surgery.

Data analysis

ECGs were classified as abnormal if any abnormali-
ties of rhythm or conduction were found during the ictal
or immediate postictal period. Isolated sinus tachycardia
(heart rate, ≥100 BPM) was not considered an abnormal-
ity and was analyzed separately. χ 2, t tests, paired t tests,
and Fisher’s exact tests were used, as appropriate, for sta-
tistical analyses.

RESULTS

Patients

Twenty-one patients (10 men, 11 women; mean age,
34.8 years; range, 20–46 years, at time of death) were
identified with probable (n = 15) or definite SUDEP
(n = 6). Mean duration of epilepsy was 23.1 years (range,
6–38 years). No patients had a history of cardiac or pul-
monary problems. Monitoring was performed a mean of
20.8 months before death (range, 2 to 78 months).

Data from 43 comparison patients (25 men, 18 women;
mean age, 34 years at time of video-EEG; range, 14–55
years) were analyzed. None had cardiac or pulmonary dis-
ease. All patients were from one institution (Jefferson) and
had partial epilepsy.

Epilepsy data

Seizure types

Seventeen patients had symptomatic or cryptogenic
partial epilepsy (81%), three had idiopathic generalized
epilepsy (14.2%), and one had symptomatic generalized
epilepsy (4.8%). Nine patients had complex partial and
GTC seizures, seven patients had complex partial seizures
(CPSs) but no GTC seizures, three patients had only GTC
seizures, and three patients had GTC and absence seizures
(see Table 1 for details). For the comparison patients, 18
had CPSs and GTC seizures, 22 had only CPSs, and three
had only GTC seizures.

Seizure frequency

At time of death, seizure frequency was one or more per
week for 38% (daily in two), one or more per month but
fewer than one per week for 19%, one or more per year but
fewer than one per month for 10%, and fewer than one per

MRI data and anticonvulsant medications

Six SUDEP patients had a normal MRI of the brain, and
11 had abnormal scans (see Table 2 for details). MRI data
were not available for the other four patients. AED data
were available for 17 patients. Of these patients, the mean
number of AEDs used by each patient at time of death
was 1.8 (range, 0–3). Twenty-nine percent were taking
phenytoin (PHT), and 35% were taking carbamazepine

tients. For the comparison group, 35% were taking PHT,
39% were taking CBZ, and 30% were taking topiramate
(TPM). All other AEDs were each used by ≤19% of pa-
tients. The mean number of AEDs used by each patient
was 1.8. No significant differences in AED use were seen
between SUDEP and comparison subjects.

Epilepsy surgery

Eleven SUDEP patients had undergone epilepsy
surgery (four, left temporal lobectomy; one, right tem-
poral lobectomy; one, right frontal lobectomy; four, an-
terior corpus callosotomy; and one, left temporal lobec-
tomy and anterior corpus callosotomy). Five of these pa-
tients had Engel class IV outcome (<80% seizure reduc-
tion), one patient had a class I outcome (the last seizure
occurred 9 months before death, only after medication
withdrawal), two had a class II outcome (rare seizures or
purely nocturnal seizures), and one patient had a class III
outcome (>80% seizure reduction). Seizure frequency be-
fore death was not certain in the other two patients. All
video-EEG/ECG data for the SUDEP and comparison pa-
tients were obtained before any epilepsy surgery.

Twenty-eight patients in the comparison group under-
went epilepsy surgery (14, right anterior temporal lobec-
tomy; five, left anterior temporal lobectomy; one, multi-
lobar resection; one, complete corpus callosotomy; one,
complete corpus callosotomy and right frontal resection;
one, anterior corpus callosotomy; one, anterior corpus cal-
losotomy and right frontal resection; one, anterior corpus
callosotomy and vagal nerve stimulator; one, left frontal

resection) after ECG data were obtained. Engel class out-
come was class I in 11, class II in seven, class III in seven,
and class IV (no worthwhile improvement) in three. No
significant difference in outcomes was seen in those indi-
viduals who underwent surgery in each group.

Timing of seizures

SUDEP patients were more likely to experience
seizures during sleep than were those in the comparison
group. Seizures occurred in both wakefulness and sleep in
the majority of SUDEP patients (67%), only during sleep
in 19%, and only from wakefulness in 9%. This informa-
tion was unavailable in one patient. For the comparison
group, 42% had seizures during wakefulness and sleep,
16% only during sleep, and 42% had seizures arising from
wakefulness only (p = 0.028).

Seizure frequency and seizure clusters

Fifty-seven percent of SUDEP patients had a history of
seizures that were known to cluster over one to a few days.
Two patients had daily seizures (20 absence seizures/day
in one patient; four CPSs/day in one patient). Three pa-
tients had a catamenial pattern of seizures. Other patients
were not noted to have seizure clusters in medical record
review. Seizure frequency and cluster data were not avail-
able from comparison patients.

Circumstances of death
State before death. Of those whose last state before death
was available (16 patients), the majority of patients were
last known to be asleep (14 of 16). Two patients were seen
to be awake before death. Eleven patients were found dead
in bed. Of these, two patients were known to be found in
the prone position. Positioning for other patients was not
known.
Last seizure. There was evidence of a seizure within 8 h
of death in seven patients. Two patients had daily seizures,
but the timing of the last seizure in relation to death was not
known. Two patients had at least two witnessed seizures
within 6 h of death (Table 1). The last seizure was not
known for all other patients.
Postmortem data. Six SUDEP patients underwent autop-
sies. A cardiac microscopic examination was performed in
two cases and discovered diffuse myocardial injury con-
sisting of hypereosinophilia, fragmentation, hypertrophy,
and myocardial fiber disarray in one patient (patient 5) and
normal findings in another patient (patient 13). Bronchial
fluid or pulmonary edema was noted in four patients.
Acute cerebral edema was noted in one case, and acute
congestion of the leptomeninges was noted in one patient.
Organomegaly (spleen, liver) was noted in two patients.
All patients had low or undetectable AED levels. One ad-
ditional patient who did not undergo a full autopsy also
had low AED levels.

Cardiac data
Baseline ECG. Five SUDEP patients had 12-lead ECGs
available for review. Two had nonspecific ST-T wave
changes, and three were normal. Interictal ECG data from
video-EEG monitoring were available from 20 patients
(see Table 4). Interictal ECG abnormalities (four of 20 pa-
tients) were not significantly more commonly seen than
in the comparison patients (three of 43) (20).

Video-EEG data
Seizures and ictal onset. A total of 90 seizures (and ad-
ditional frequent absence seizures in one patient) with
ictal ECG data available (n = 16) were reviewed in
SUDEP patients; the mean number of seizures per patient
(whose seizures were recorded and not including absence
seizures) was 5.6. (See Table 3 for details.) Seizure local-
ization varied, and no specific lateralization or lobe of on-
set was identified for those with partial epilepsy (Table 3).
Seizure onset also varied in the comparison population
(20).

Ictal ECG
Maximal heart rate. Of the 16 SUDEP patients with ictal
ECGs, 15 (94%) had sinus tachycardia during or shortly
after seizures. The other patient had only brief absence
seizures and had a maximal heart rate of 96 BPM as-
sociated with seizures. Although this patient had GTC
seizures as well, none were recorded in the hospital. The
majority (84%) of the comparison group also had sinus
tachycardia associated with their seizures (mean maximal
HR, 126 BPM); however, the maximal HR was signif-
icantly higher for those with SUDEP (mean, 149 BPM
for SUDEP; SD, 15.8; p < 0.001). Because of the dif-
ferences in epilepsy types between the two groups, the
maximal HR also was calculated for those in the SUDEP
group with partial epilepsy only. These patients also had
a significantly higher mean maximal HR (143 BPM; p <
0.001).
Rhythm and repolarization. Sixteen SUDEP patients
had ictal ECGs available for review. Of these, nine (56%)
patients had ictal rhythm or repolarization abnormalities
(see Table 4). The types of abnormalities and frequency of
abnormalities were similar to those of the control popula-
tion (39%; p = 0.39). Two had an increased frequency
of ventricular premature depolarizations; atrial fibrilla-
tion (and atrial flutter in one) occurred in two patients;
marked or moderate sinus arrhythmia was seen in four pa-
tients; and ST-segment elevation occurred in one patient.
A rate-related right bundle branch block (considered nor-
mal) occurred in three patients. Two patients’ data were
normal throughout. Movement artifact severely limited
ECG evaluation in four patients, but no abnormalities were
noted in the portions of ECG that were not obscured by
artifact.
Seizure clusters and heart rate response. Eight SUDEP
patients had seizure clusters consisting of three or more

seizures occurring within 6 h of each other during video-
EEG monitoring. A tendency was noted for incremental
increases in HR to occur when seizures occurred within
a cluster. Both preictal and maximal HRs increased in
the majority of patients (six of eight patients). This effect
was seen more frequently when seizures clustered together
closely, as in patient 3 (Fig. 1); however, this could also
be seen when seizures occurred within a few hours of
each other, as in patient 9 (Fig. 2). Cluster data were not
available for the comparison group.
Seizure types and heart rate and rhythm type. GTC
seizures in SUDEP patients were generally associated
with a greater maximal HR than were other seizure types.
For GTC seizures, the mean maximal HR was 169 BPM;
for CPS, 140 BPM; p < 0.001. Tonic seizures were as-
sociated with maximal HRs between 120 and 133 BPM
(HR increase during seizures between 6 and 31 BPM). Ab-
sence seizures were associated with minimal HR changes.
Rhythm abnormalities occurred in both CPSs and GTC
seizures and were not more commonly seen in a specific
state. Seizure duration was not analyzed separately.
State and cardiac rate and rhythm. In SUDEP patients,
a greater degree of HR increase was seen during CPSs and
GTC seizures arising from sleep than during those from
wakefulness (mean increase in HR, 78 BPM in sleep, 47

Epilepsia, Vol. 45, No. 4, 2004

BPM in wakefulness, p < 0.001). This difference was
seen independently with CPSs (mean increase, 70 BPM
in sleep, SD = 22.4; 48 BPM in wakefulness, SD = 22.9;
p = 0.019) and also tended to be seen with GTC seizures
(mean increase, 87 BPM in sleep, SD = 16; 63 BPM in
wakefulness, SD = 21; p = 0.058). Because of the rela-
tively small number of patients with generalized epilepsy,
it is difficult to determine whether timing of seizures dif-
fered between those with generalized epilepsy and partial
epilepsy (see Table 4 for details).

For the comparison population, no significant differ-
ence was noted in HR change during seizures associated
with sleep (52 BPM) as compared with wakefulness (43
BPM), p = 0.27. In this group, no significant difference
occurred in percentages of CPSs and GTC seizures occur-
ring during the two states.

DISCUSSION

Although studies to date have revealed that seizures can
cause respiratory and cardiac abnormalities, this study
reveals, for the first time, evidence of increased autonomic
activity associated with seizures in patients who later died
of SUDEP, as compared with a clinically similar com-
parison population. Seizure-associated HR increases were

abnormalities was not significantly higher than in the com-
parison group. These abnormalities offer further evidence
of the extreme autonomic stimulation that occurred during
seizures in this population. Additionally, whereas previ-
ous studies revealed evidence of postmortem myocardial
injury in SUDEP patients (29,30), the present study re-
veals such injury associated with evidence of a clinically
significant cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation and flut-
ter) before death in one patient.

As previously noted, patients with SUDEP were young,
most had a history of GTC seizures, were last known to
be asleep before death, and were often found in bed. At
least one third had a recent seizure before death. All pa-
tients with postmortem examinations had low AED levels,
suggesting that they may have been at elevated risk for
having seizures at the time of death. Alternatively, the low
levels seen may represent an artifact of postmortem detec-
tion. Because AEDs were tapered in a similar fashion in
both control and SUDEP patients during video-EEG/ECG
monitoring, significant differences in the number of AEDs
at any given time during monitoring is unlikely, particu-
larly because both groups were taking similar numbers and
types of AEDs. Thus it is unlikely that AED differences
contributed to HR or rhythm differences between the two
groups. Additionally, seizure clusters were seen in approx-
imately half of the SUDEP patients, and some had known
seizure clusters just before death. However, neither loca-
tion nor lateralization of the epileptogenic zone appeared
to be associated with a heightened risk of death. Although
the majority of patients had abnormal MRI brain scans,
no common pathologic substrate was found.

These data suggest several factors that may be related
to SUDEP: (a) the sleep state, which may produce physio-
logical conditions increasing the likelihood of SUDEP; (b)
seizures (particularly GTC seizures) might directly precip-
itate death; and (c) seizure clusters. The majority of pa-
tients died during sleep, supporting that these patients had
greater vulnerability to SUDEP during this state. These
patients additionally had evidence of marked sympathetic
tone during seizures arising from sleep. This increased
autonomic instability during seizures arising from sleep
may be a key factor in SUDEP. Sleep is generally asso-
ciated with increased vagal tone (causing relative brady-
cardia) (29–31). SUDEP may be related to mechanisms
similar to those of sudden cardiac death, which is asso-
ciated with a peak incidence in the morning. Death in
these cases is thought to be related to sudden surges in
catecholamines associated with awakening (32,33). In a
similar but perhaps even more striking manner, seizures
from sleep could cause sudden and extreme fluctuations
in autonomic tone (from predominant vagal tone to sud-
den and extreme sympathetic tone), which might precipi-
tate lethal cardiac arrhythmias. This change from vagal to
sympathetic stimulation would be expected to be greatest
in younger individuals, because their baseline vagal tone is

Epilepsia, Vol. 45, No. 4, 2004

higher (36), and may explain why most SUDEP patients
die at a relatively young age. GTC seizures and seizure
clusters may increase the risk of SUDEP further in these
individuals because of more sustained and even greater
degrees of autonomic stimulation. These data suggest that
seizure clusters occurring during sleep in a young person
with uncontrolled epilepsy may be particularly dangerous.
Additional autonomic evaluation, such as HR variability
assessment in wakefulness and sleep in this population,
may further define whether these patients have significant
differences in autonomic tone as compared with a non-
SUDEP population.

Sudden death due to a cardiac arrhythmia is more likely
when underlying structural disease exists (35). In SUDEP,
postmortem studies have not shown gross abnormalities
(6). However, myocardial injury has been identified at
a microscopic level. This may be sufficient to result in
significant arrhythmias, particularly during catecholamine
surges associated with seizures. Such a mechanism may
explain SUDEP in some individuals. Although this study
was not able to identify any specific common rhythm ab-
normality in these patients, it is intriguing that many pa-
tients had evidence of a cardiac arrhythmia or ST-segment
elevation in association with seizures and that two had
atrial fibrillation, which is not a common seizure-induced
arrhythmia. Video-EEG monitoring captures only a brief
period in the course of a patient’s epilepsy, and longer
recordings would likely have revealed an even greater in-
cidence of arrhythmias. A greater number of patients also
may have had myocardial injury identified with micro-
scopic cardiac examinations. Perhaps the catecholamine
surges associated with repeated seizures could cause such
injury in a similar manner as in other catecholamine-rich
states, including pheochromocytoma (36). In a destructive
cycle, seizures could first cause this injury, which would
later serve as the substrate for lethal arrhythmias during
further seizures. However, this now remains speculative.
As with any retrospective study of mortality, limitations
exist in the data available. Information regarding respira-
tory patterns might shed additional important clues re-
garding the mechanism of SUDEP. This study focused on
cardiac data because pulmonary data were lacking. The
postmortem data revealed bronchial fluid or pulmonary
edema in four of six cases, and it is possible that the in-
creased autonomic stimulation associated with seizures in
SUDEP seen in this study may contribute to pulmonary
changes that may be important in SUDEP. Other factors
that might affect the results include the availability of only
one channel of ECG and baseline HR taken 1 min before
each seizure. As with any mortality study, it is difficult
to determine an ideal control population for comparison.
Although our comparison group was not a matched sam-
ple, we assured that they were similar in that all had a
history of refractory epilepsy, were young, used similar
AEDs, and had similar seizure types. Because of these

very similarities, some of the control subjects may even-
tually die of SUDEP. However, it is likely that the majority
of these control subjects will not die of SUDEP, and thus
it is likely that their data reflect this majority influence. Of
note, the control group did differ in that all patients had
partial epilepsy, whereas the SUDEP group included in-
dividuals with generalized epilepsy. However, when only
those SUDEP patients with partial epilepsy were com-
pared with the comparison group, similar findings were
observed. Thus it is unlikely that epilepsy type alone can
explain differences seen between the two groups.

In conclusion, this study suggests that patients with evi-
dence of a great degree of change in autonomic tone during
seizures might be at increased risk for SUDEP. Although
the precise mechanism of death remains elusive, these data
nevertheless suggest that prevention of nocturnal seizures
and seizure clusters may be important in reducing the risk
for SUDEP. Accurate diagnosis of nocturnal seizures and
evaluation of their frequency, with either long-term am-
bulatory or inpatient EEG monitoring, may be more im-
portant than has been generally considered. Aggressive
treatment, even when seizures are only nocturnal, might
help reduce the risk of SUDEP. Elimination of seizures
is ideal, but when this cannot be accomplished, it is pos-
sible that other measures to reduce autonomic instability
specifically in selected patients, such as use of β-blockers,
might aid in preventing SUDEP. However, further investi-
gation is needed to evaluate the role of such potential ther-
apy, with caution regarding other possible mechanisms of
SUDEP, including increased parasympathetic activity or
bronchoconstriction.
