Abstract
Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain characterized by an 
enduring  (i.e.,  persisting)  predisposition  to  generate  sei-
zures,  unprovoked  by  any  immediate  central  nervous  sys-
tem insult, and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychologi-
cal, and social consequences of seizure recurrences. Epilepsy 
affects both sexes and all ages with worldwide distribution. 
The  prevalence  and  the  incidence  of  epilepsy  are  slightly 
higher in men compared to women and tend to peak in the 
elderly, reflecting the higher frequency of stroke, neurode-
generative diseases, and tumors in this age-group. Focal sei-
zures are more common than generalized seizures both in 
children and in adults. The etiology of epilepsy varies accord-
ing to the sociodemographic characteristics of the affected 
populations and the extent of the diagnostic workup, but a 
documented cause is still lacking in about 50% of cases from 
high-income  countries  (HIC).  The  overall  prognosis  of  epi-
lepsy is favorable in the majority of patients when measured 
by seizure freedom. Reports from low/middle-income coun-
tries (LMIC; where patients with epilepsy are largely untreat-
ed) give prevalence and remission rates that overlap those 
of HICs. As the incidence of epilepsy appears higher in most 
LMICs, the overlapping prevalence can be explained by mis-
diagnosis, acute symptomatic seizures and premature mor-
tality. Studies have consistently shown that about one-half 
of cases tend to achieve prolonged seizure remission. How-
ever, more recent reports on the long-term prognosis of ep-

ilepsy have identified differing prognostic patterns, includ-
ing  early  and  late  remission,  a  relapsing-remitting  course, 
and  even  a  worsening  course  (characterized  by  remission 
followed by relapse and unremitting seizures). Epilepsy per 
se carries a low mortality risk, but significant differences in 
mortality rates are expected when comparing incidence and 
prevalence studies, children and adults, and persons with id-
iopathic  and  symptomatic  seizures.  Sudden  unexplained 
death  is  most  frequent  in  people  with  generalized  tonic-
clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, and drug refractory epi-
lepsy.

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological dis-
eases and affects people of all ages, races, social classes, 
and  geographical  locations.  Epilepsy  is  a  disease  of  the 
brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to gen-
erate  seizures  and  by  the  neurobiologic,  cognitive,  psy-
chological, and social consequences of seizure recurrenc-
es  [1].  The  epileptic  seizures  are  recurrent  paroxysmal 
events  characterized  by  stereotyped  behavioral  altera-
tions that reflect the underlying neural mechanisms of the 
disease. The differential diagnosis of epilepsy encompass-
es a number of clinical conditions characterized by tran-
sient  alteration  of  awareness  and/or  behavior.  In  most 
cases, the disease can be diagnosed through a careful his-
tory or by the observation of a seizure. Although an etio-
logic agent can be identified, still in about one half of cas-
es, the cause is unknown [2]. A variable genetic predispo-
sition to manifest seizures and the differing distribution 
of some environmental risk factors can explain the het-

erogeneity of the frequency, course, and consequences of 
the disease in the world. In addition to the recurrence of 
seizures, the underlying cause and the adverse effects of 
treatment have neurologic, cognitive, psychological, and 
social consequences that significantly affect the quality of 
life  of  the  affected  individuals  and  make  the  disease  a 
complex nosographic entity.

Definitions and Terminology

While all people with epilepsy experience seizures, not 
all individuals with seizures have epilepsy. Epileptic sei-
zures may also occur after an acute central nervous system 
(CNS)  insult  (structural,  systemic,  toxic,  or  metabolic). 
These events (acute symptomatic or provoked seizures) are 
intended as acute manifestations of the insult [3] and may 
not recur when the underlying cause has been removed or 
the acute phase has elapsed [4]. According to the Interna-
tional League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), epilepsy is defined 
by any of the following conditions: (1) at least 2 unpro-
voked (or reflex) seizures occurring > 24 h apart; (2) one 
unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further 
seizures  similar  to  the  general  recurrence  risk  (at  least 
60%) after 2 unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 
10 years; and (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome [5]. 
However, for the purpose of conducting population-based 
studies, the ILAE Epidemiology Commission advises that 
epilepsy be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures oc-
curring at least 24 h apart [6].

An unprovoked seizure is a seizure occurring in the ab-
sence  of  precipitating  factors.  Unprovoked  seizures  in-
clude events occurring in the absence of recognized etio-
logical or risk factors (idiopathic and cryptogenic seizures), 
in patients with antecedent stable (nonprogressing) CNS 
insults  (remote  symptomatic  seizures),  or  in  those  with 
progressive CNS abnormalities, like brain tumors or de-
generative conditions (progressive symptomatic seizures).
Seizure  onset  can  be  focal  (seizures  arising  in  one 
hemisphere of the brain), generalized (seizures originat-
ing in both hemispheres simultaneously), and unknown 
[7].  Focal  seizures  are  classified  according  to  whether 
awareness (a marker for consciousness) is intact or im-
paired.  Focal  and  generalized  seizures  are  also  divided 
into motor and nonmotor.

Active epilepsy is defined by regular treatment with an-
tiepileptic medications or when the most recent seizure 
has occurred within the last 5 years [6].

Status epilepticus (SE) is an epileptic seizure that is suf-
ficiently prolonged or repeated at sufficiently brief inter-

vals so as to produce an enduring epileptic condition. SE 
can have long-term consequences including neuronal in-
jury  or  death  and  alteration  of  neuronal  networks,  de-
pending on the type and duration of seizures. A new diag-
nostic classification of SE has been recently proposed [8]. 
Sudden  unexpected  death  in  epilepsy  (SUDEP)  is  the 
sudden, unexpected, witnessed or unwitnessed, nontrau-
matic, and nondrowning death in patients with epilepsy, 
with or without evidence for a seizure and excluding doc-
umented SE, in which postmortem examination does not 
reveal  a  toxicologic  or  anatomic  cause  of  death  [9].  In 
most cases, SUDEP is triggered by a seizure, and seizure-
induced cardiorespiratory alterations are a plausible hy-
pothesis.

Measures  of  the  frequency  of  epilepsy  include  inci-
dence, prevalence, and mortality; measures of the burden 
of epilepsy are the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
and their components, the years of life lost, and the years 
of living with disability.

Incidence of Acute Symptomatic Seizures

The median incidence of acute symptomatic seizures 
is 29–39 per 100,000 per year [10]. Acute symptomatic 
seizures  predominate  in  the  youngest  age  class  (under 
1 year of age) and in the elderly. Fever, traumatic brain 
injury  (TBI),  cerebrovascular  disease,  drug  withdrawal, 
infection, and metabolic insults are the commonest pre-
cipitating factors.

Incidence of Epilepsy

In  a  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  of  inci-
dence studies, the pooled incidence rate of epilepsy was 
61.4 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 50.7–74.4) [11]. 
The incidence was higher in  low/middle-income coun-
tries  (LMIC)  than  in  high-income  countries  (HIC), 
139.0 (95% CI 69.4–278.2) vs. 48.9 (95% CI 39.0–61.1). 
This can be explained by the different structure of pop-
ulations at risk and a greater exposure to perinatal risk 
factors,  higher  rates  of  CNS  infections,  and  TBI  in 
LMIC.  The  incidence  of  epilepsy  is  also  higher  in  the 
lowest  socioeconomic  classes  in  HIC  and,  within  the 
same population, people of differing ethnic origin [12]. 
Differences can be also explained by methodological is-
sues,  such  as  more  stringent  case  verification  and  the 
exclusion of isolated and acute symptomatic seizures in 
some studies.

Prevalence of Epilepsy

The prevalence of epilepsy differs significantly among 
countries depending on the local distribution of risk and 
etiologic factors, the number of seizures at diagnosis and 
if considering only active epilepsy (active prevalence) or 
including also cases in remission (lifetime prevalence). In 
the Fiest et al. [11], the overall lifetime prevalence of epi-
lepsy was 7.60 per 1,000 population (95% CI 6.17–9.38) 
and was higher in LMIC (8.75 per 1,000; 95% CI 7.23–
10.59) than in HIC (5.18 per 1,000; 95% CI 3.75–7.15). 
The point prevalence of active epilepsy was 6.38 per 1,000 
(95% CI 5.57–7.30). The median point prevalence of ac-
tive epilepsy in LMIC was 6.68 (95% CI 5.45–8.10) and in 
HIC was 5.49 (4.16–7.26). In selected populations, preva-
lence estimates also vary and tend to be higher in indi-
viduals of certain ethnicities [13], people in poor health, 
and socially deprived subjects [14]. Along with issues in 
the study design, the demographic structure of the study 
population, the prevalence of environmental risk factors, 
and the quality of health management can be implicated.

Incidence and Prevalence of Epilepsy by Sex and Age

Incidence and prevalence of epilepsy are slightly high-
er in men than in women [11]. The difference might be 
explained by the different prevalence of the most com-
mon risk factors and the concealment of the condition in 
women for sociocultural reasons in certain regions [15].
The incidence of epilepsy is higher in the youngest and 
oldest age-groups [11], with estimates of 86 per 100,000 
per year in a well-defined population in the first year of 
age,  a  trend  to  decrease  to  about  23–31  per  100,000  in 
people aged 30–59 years, and a subsequent increase up to 
180 per 100,000 in the over 85 age-group [16]. In children, 
the incidence of epilepsy is highest in the first year of life 
and declines to adult levels by the end of 10 years of age 
[17]. In LMIC, epilepsy peaks in children; this may be a 
result of under-ascertainment of the condition in older 
individuals  as  well  as  the  demographic  structure  of  the 
country.

Temporal Trends of Epilepsy

In the last decades, the age-specific incidence of epi-
lepsy has decreased with time in the youngest age-groups, 
probably  due  to  improvements  in  perinatal  care,  better 
sanitation,  and  increased  control  of  infectious  diseases 

[18]. In contrast, the incidence has increased in the elder-
ly,  likely  due  to  improved  life  expectancy  (with  parallel 
increase of aging-related epileptogenic conditions, such as 
stroke, tumors, and neurodegenerative disorders) and in-
creased ascertainment of the disease in this age-group.

Incidence and Prevalence by Seizure Type

Focal seizures are the predominant seizure type both 
in children and in adults [16, 19]. The most common type 
of focal seizure is a focal impaired awareness seizure (ac-
counting  for  approximately  36%  of  all  people  with  sei-
zures)  [16].  In  most  LMIC,  however,  the  predominant 
types reported are generalized tonic-clonic seizures [20], 
a reflection of under-ascertainment of the other seizure 
types, likely due to a lack of recognition and diagnostic 
tools. The incidence of SE has been found to vary from 
6.8 to 41 per 100,000 per year [21] with a bimodal distri-
bution (peaks in children < 1 year and the elderly). The 
wide range can be explained by the population at risk, the 
accuracy of the diagnosis, the differing distribution of the 
underlying causes, and the inclusion or exclusion of acute 
symptomatic seizures.

Incidence and Prevalence by Epilepsy Type

In a population-based study done 20 years ago in a US 
population  [22],  focal  epilepsies  of  unknown  etiology 
were the most common group in people newly diagnosed 
with epilepsy (17.5 cases per 100,000 per year), followed 
by  symptomatic  partial  epilepsies  (focal  epilepsies  of 
structural  or  metabolic  etiology  according  to  the  new 
ILAE classification) [23] (17.2), unknown epilepsies (ep-
ilepsies of unknown etiology; 9.7), symptomatic/crypto-
genic epilepsies (epilepsies of structural or metabolic eti-
ology/unknown etiology; 4.0), idiopathic generalized ep-
ilepsies  (3.7),  and  idiopathic  partial  epilepsies  (i.e., 
generalized and focal epilepsies of presumed genetic ori-
gin; 0.2). The proportion of epilepsies with unknown eti-
ology has remained substantially unchanged in more re-
cent years, at least in HIC [24].

In  children,  age  at  onset  was  significantly  correlated 
with  etiology.  Approximately  half  had  a  documentable 
etiology. Of them, 28% were structural/metabolic, which 
predominated when seizures started before 12 months of 
age, and 22% were presumedly genetic, most likely associ-
ated with older age at onset [19]. A specific epilepsy syn-
drome could be detected in 28% of cases at first diagnosis.

Prognosis of Epilepsy

Epilepsy is a treatable condition, with up to 80% enter-
ing prolonged periods of seizure remission and up to 50% 
continuing to be seizure-free after treatment discontinu-
ation  [25,  26].  However,  reports  from  several  LMIC 
(where treatment gap is high) give prevalence and remis-
sion rates overlapping to HIC [27]. As in most LMIC, the 
incidence of epilepsy is higher than in HIC and increased 
mortality can explain only in part the difference between 
incidence and prevalence, misdiagnosis and acute symp-
tomatic seizures must be also considered.

Studies in newly diagnosed patients have consistently 
shown  that  55–68%  of  cases  tend  to  achieve  prolonged 
seizure remission [27]. However, in a long-term popula-
tion-based study done in patients with childhood-onset 
epilepsy, differing remission patterns were seen. Half of 
the patients entered terminal remission, without relapse, 
and one-fifth after relapse. About one-third had a poor 
outcome in terms of absolute absence of remission or re-
lapsing  seizures  after  periods  of  remission  [26].  These 
patterns have been confirmed in part by others [28–31].
The risk of relapse after a first unprovoked seizure in 
population-based studies was fairly consistent with 36–
37% rates at 1 year and 43–45% rates at 2 years [27]. In a 
systematic review, the average recurrence risk was 51% 
(95% CI 49–53%) [32]. After a first unprovoked seizure, 
the  probability  of  a  relapse  decreases  with  time.  About 
50% of recurrences occur within 6 months. A document-
ed etiology of the seizure and an abnormal (epileptiform 
and/or  slow)  electroencephalogram  (EEG)  pattern  are 
the 2 most consistent predictors of recurrence. The pooled 
2-year recurrence risk is lowest for an idiopathic or cryp-
togenic  first  seizure  with  a  normal  EEG  (24%;  95%  CI 
19–29%), intermediate for a remote symptomatic seizure 
(48%; 95% CI 34–62%) with normal EEG or an idiopath-
ic/cryptogenic seizure with an abnormal EEG (48%; 95% 
CI 40–55%), and highest with a remote symptomatic sei-
zure with an abnormal EEG (65%; 95% CI 55–76%) [32]. 
Interictal EEG epileptiform abnormalities tend to be as-
sociated  with  a  higher  risk  of  seizure  recurrence  than 
non-epileptiform abnormalities. Seizures occurring dur-
ing sleep are also associated with a higher risk of recur-
rence both in children and in adults. Focal seizures are 
also correlated with a higher risk of recurrence, even after 
controlling for etiology and EEG abnormalities. A posi-
tive correlation between seizure relapse and family his-
tory of seizures has been confirmed in patients with idio-
pathic  or  cryptogenic  first  seizures.  History  of  acute 
symptomatic seizures prior to the first unprovoked sei-

zure has been found to increase the risk of relapse, while 
evidence is inconclusive or lacking for sex, age, and SE.

The  prognosis  of  untreated  epilepsy  can  be  assessed 
only in LMIC where epilepsy is largely untreated (treat-
ment gap ranging from 70 to 94%) [33]. In a population-
based study done in Ecuador, the cumulative annual in-
cidence rate was 190 per 100,000 and the prevalence rate 
of active epilepsy was 7 per 1,000, which implies a remis-
sion rate of at least 50% [34]. Similar prevalence rates of 
active  epilepsy  were  found  in  other  countries  [35,  36]. 
These findings lend support to the hypothesis that spon-
taneous remission of epilepsy is a common event.

Etiology of epilepsy is the strongest prognostic predic-
tor for seizure recurrence. In a well-defined US popula-
tion,  symptomatic  epilepsies  had  a  significantly  lower 
chance of 5-year remission compared to idiopathic epi-
lepsies (30 vs. 42% at 15 years) and patients with neuro-
logical dysfunction present at birth had the lowest chance 
of remission [25]. Other prognostic indicators included 
seizure type and EEG epileptiform abnormalities. Lower 
remission rates in patients with symptomatic epilepsies 
were found also in Europe [27]. 

As proposed by Sander [37], epilepsy patients can be 
classified into 4 different prognostic groups: (1) Excellent 
prognosis (about 20–30% of the total) with high probabil-
ity of spontaneous remission; these include benign focal 
epilepsies, benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, and ep-
ilepsies provoked by specific modes of activation, that is, 
reflex  epilepsies;  (2)  Good  prognosis  (about  30–40%) 
with  easy  pharmacological  control  and  possibility  of 
spontaneous remission; these include childhood absence 
epilepsy and some focal epilepsies; (3) Uncertain progno-
sis  (about  10–20%),  which  may  respond  to  drugs,  but 
tend to relapse after treatment withdrawal; these include 
juvenile  myoclonic  epilepsy  and  most  focal  epilepsies 
(symptomatic or cryptogenic); (4) Poor prognosis (about 
20%)  in  which  seizures  tend  to  recur  despite  intensive 
treatment; these include epilepsies associated with con-
genital neurological defects, progressive neurological dis-
orders, and some symptomatic or cryptogenic partial ep-
ilepsies. This classification is still valid even after the ad-
vent  of  more  sophisticated  diagnostic  techniques  and 
after the introduction of several new antiepileptic drugs.

Mortality of Epilepsy

Epilepsy per se carries a low mortality risk, but signifi-
cant differences in mortality rates are expected when com-
paring  incidence  and  prevalence  studies,  children  and

adults, and persons with idiopathic and symptomatic sei-
zures [38]. As with prevalence and incidence, epilepsy mor-
tality reflects the quality of case ascertainment, the accuracy 
of the information on causes of death and the survey meth-
ods [6]. People with epilepsy are at an increased risk of death 
than the general population [38]. Among deaths attribut-
able to epilepsy or seizures, important immediate causes 
include SUDEP, SE, unintentional injuries, and suicide.

In HIC, standardized mortality ratio ranges from 1.6 
to 3.0 [38]. In LMIC, the corresponding ratio is 19.8 (95% 
CI 9.7–45.1) [39]. Standardized mortality ratio is slightly 
higher in men than in women and in children and ado-
lescents, in people with epilepsies due to documented eti-
ology, and in those reporting less adherence to treatment. 
Indirect causes of death in LMIC include not only drown-
ing and burns but also lack of access to health facilities 
and preventable causes.

The incidence of SUDEP among people with epilepsy 
is 1.2 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 0.9–1.5) and ranges 
from 1.1 (95% CI 0.5–2.3) in children under age 16 years 
to 1.3 (95% CI 0.9–1.8) in adults after the age of 50 years 
[40].  The  major  risk  factors  include  generalized  tonic-

clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, and persistence of sei-
zures.  Freedom  from  seizures,  particularly  generalized 
tonic-clonic, is associated with decreased risk and noctur-
nal supervision is protective [41].

Burden of Epilepsy

According to the 2016 Global Burden of Disease Col-
laborators [18], epilepsy represents a relevant fraction of 
the worldwide disease burden, accounting for about 46 
million people. Nearly 80% of people with epilepsy reside 
in  LMIC,  where  rates  of  epilepsy  prevalence  and  inci-
dence  are  higher  than  in  HIC  [42].  The  differences  are 
likely due to differing causes, a higher incidence of inju-
ries, and lack of access to health care.

In  2016,  epilepsy  accounted  for  > 13  million  DALYs 
and was responsible for 0.5% of the total disease burden 
[18]. In terms of age-standardized DALY rates for all neu-
rological disorders by Global Burden of Disease region in 
2016, epilepsy ranked second to eighth depending on the 
geographic  region.  The  burden  of  idiopathic  epilepsy

(i.e., due to a genetic cause or when diagnostic assessment 
did not reveal a causative factor) was highest in eastern, 
western, and southern sub-Saharan Africa, central Asia, 
central  and  Andean  Latin  America,  and  southeast  Asia 
(Fig. 1).

Age-standardized DALYs were 182.6 per 100,000 pop-
ulation,  163.6  per  100,000  population  for  women,  and 
201.2 per 100,000 population for men. The higher DALY 
rates in men than in women were due to higher years of 
life lost rates. Between 1990 and 2016, there was a nonsig-
nificant 6.0% increase in the age-standardized prevalence 
of idiopathic epilepsy, but a significant decrease in age-
standardized mortality rates (–24.5%) and age-standard-
ized DALY rates (–19.4%).

Between  1990  and  2016,  a  significant  reduction  was 
observed in the mortality rate in people with idiopathic 
epilepsy and, to a lesser extent, a reduction was found in 
DALY rates [18]. This finding probably reflects improve-
ments in access to health facilities and treatment, which 
in  turn  may  lead  to  a  lesser  severity  of  the  disease  and 
lower risk of death.

The Change of the Population Health and Its Impact 
on the Epidemiology of Epilepsy

The data on the global burden of epilepsy have clearly 
demonstrated that, contrary to other clinical conditions, 
the disease presents a decreasing trend, mostly explained 
by a significant reduction of mortality. A significant de-
crease of communicable diseases as a reflection of better 
sanitation  and  the introduction of preventive measures 
leads to the reduction of many environmental risk factors 
and  epileptogenic  conditions.  Better  health  care  is  also 
followed by increased survival and, in turn, by a longer 

life expectancy. The progressive aging of the worldwide 
population is accompanied by a shift of age-specific inci-
dence and prevalence of epilepsy with a progressive de-
crease  of  the  disease  in  the  youngest  age-groups  and  a 
corresponding increase in the elderly. A better control of 
preventable causes of epileptic seizures, which mostly in-
clude pre-/perinatal injuries, CNS infections and infesta-
tions, TBI, and stroke [43], will be followed by a decrease 
of these clinical conditions but an increase in aging-relat-
ed  diseases  (in  particular,  CNS  tumors  and  Alzheimer 
disease and other dementias).

Conclusions and Future Directions

Despite the decrease in the disease burden, epilepsy is 
still an important cause of disability and mortality. If ap-
plied to epidemiological studies, the change in the defini-
tion of epilepsy, which now includes a significant number 
of cases with single unprovoked seizures, will affect inci-
dence, prevalence, and mortality of epilepsy in the future. 
However, the collection of data on epilepsy in representa-
tive population samples and using standardized methods 
will  strengthen  the  estimates  and  will  provide  accurate 
findings in countries for which we currently have no or 
sparse data and if additional data are collected on sever-
ity, causes, and treatments. Sizable gains in reducing the 
burden of epilepsy might be expected from improved ac-
cess to existing treatments in low-income countries and 
from the development of new effective drugs worldwide.
