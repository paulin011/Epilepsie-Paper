Summary: Purpose: To determine the prevalence of heart rate
changes and ECG abnormalities during epileptic seizures and
to determine the timing of heart rate changes compared to the
first electrographic and clinical signs. To assess the risk factors
for the occurrence of ECG abnormalities.

Methods: We analyzed retrospectively 281 seizures in 81
patients with intractable epilepsy who had prolonged video-
EEG and two-channel ECG. The nature and timing of heart rate
changes compared to the electrographic and clinical seizure
onset was determined. The ictal period (including one minute
preictally and three minutes postictally) was analyzed for car-
diac arrhythmias, conduction and repolarization abnormalities.
Risk factors for cardiac abnormalities were investigated using
parametric and non-parametric statistics.

Results: There was an increase in heart rate of at least 10
beats/minute in 73% of seizures (93% of patients) and this

occurred most often around seizure onset. In 23% of seizures
(49% of patients) the rate increase preceded both the electro-
graphic and the clinical onset. ECG abnormalities were found
in 26% of seizures (44% of patients). One patient had an asys-
tole for 30 seconds. Long seizure duration increased the oc-
currence of ECG abnormalities. No other risk factor was
found.

Conclusions: Heart rate changes occur frequently and occur
around the time or even before the earliest electrographic or
clinical change. The change can clarify the timing of seizure
onset and the specific rate pattern may be useful for seizure
diagnosis and for automatic seizure detection. ECG abnormali-
ties occur often and repeatedly in several seizures of the same
patient. Key Words: Heart rate—ECG—Epilepsy—Seizure
onset—Asystole.

Heart rate changes at the onset of epileptic seizures are
often overlooked as a clinical sign. An increase in heart
rate has been described in a high proportion of seizures
(1–7) and the timing of these changes may provide useful
clinical information. The purpose of our study is to de-
scribe the timing of changes in heart rate compared to the
electrographic and clinical seizure onset. Although heart
rate changes have often been described in seizures, the
specific timing of these changes has not been reported. If
the increase is at the onset or even before a seizure, it
could be a helpful additional clinical sign in determining
seizure onset. The prevalence of heart rate changes and
their timing might also suggest uses for ECG detectors in
the effort to detect seizures automatically.

While most studies have noted increases in heart rate
around some seizures, there are also instances of de-
creased heart rate, and an increased occurrence of serious
ECG abnormalities (1,2,8). Sudden unexpected death in

epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major cause of death in patients
with epilepsy, especially in patients with intractable epi-
lepsy (9,10) and SUDEP occurs much more when pa-
tients are having seizures (11). Cardiac and respiratory
changes could possibly contribute to SUDEP (12) and it
is known that ECG abnormalities occur often during or
after seizures (1,2,13). Cardiac arrests and severe brady-
arrhythmias during seizures have been described often in
case reports (14–25) and ECG abnormalities appear to
occur more often during generalized seizures and within
seizures of longer duration (1,2). We describe the occur-
rence of ECG abnormalities in a large group of patients
and in several seizures per patient and evaluate the pos-
sible risk factors for the occurrence of ECG abnormali-
ties.

METHODS

Subjects

We retrospectively assessed 104 patients with intrac-
table epilepsy who were admitted to the EEG telemetry
unit of the Montreal Neurological Hospital between
January 2000 and June 2001. EEG, ECG and video data

were obtained with the Harmonie monitoring system
(Stellate Systems, Montreal, Canada). We reviewed elec-
trographic, partial and generalized epileptic seizures but
did not consider auras or what seemed to be pseudo-
seizures. The study duration for the patients included in
the study was 1–14 days. Some patients had few and
others had a very large number of seizures. Therefore, to
reduce the bias introduced by patients with a large num-
ber of seizures, we limited our analysis to five represen-
tative seizures per patient. Seizures were usually taken
sequentially. When the first five seizures were very simi-
lar clinically and other seizure types were also present in
the patient, we skipped some of the earlier seizures to
extend the clinical spectrum of seizure patterns. Seizure
duration was based on clinical data. On some occasions,
seizure termination was based on EEG criteria when the
patient’s behavior did not indicate clearly the end of the
seizure. For seizures without clinical manifestations, sei-
zure length was obviously determined from the EEG.

ECG

ECG data were obtained by two supraclavicular ECG-
leads (left and right) along with a 32-lead EEG. The ECG
was reviewed in referential montage (ECG1-FCz, ECG2-
FCz) and bipolar (ECG1-ECG2). Classification of ECG
abnormalities was performed by one of the authors, and
questionable situations were reviewed by two physicians
in consensus. Review of the ECG signal was done with
knowledge of EEG seizure discharge. No automatic ECG
analysis was used. For each seizure the following data
were collected.

Seizure onset and heart rate changes. The electro-
graphic and clinical seizure onsets were obtained from
the physician’s EEG reports. For each seizure, a baseline
heart rate was obtained using 30 s starting one minute
before seizure onset, electrographic or clinical, which-
ever came first.

Ictal heart rate was assessed from 30 s prior to the
moment of clinical or electrographic seizure onset
(whichever came first) up until 30 s after the end of the
seizure. Heart rate was estimated by counting beats over
six-second epochs and multiplying that value by ten (one
minute). We assessed the timing of the earliest epoch in
which the heart rate exceeded the baseline rate by 10
beats/minute, 20 beats/minute or when it decreased by 10
beats/minute or more.

Minimum and maximum heart rate. The highest
and the lowest ictal heart rate were determined. Further-
more, if the heart rate became less than 60 beats/minute,
we defined the event as bradycardia and if the heart rate
exceeded 100 beats/minute we defined it as tachycardia.
ECG abnormalities. We assessed one minute of pre-
ictal, the entire ictal period and three minutes of post-
ictal ECG for abnormalities. The abnormalities were
classified using the following classification (26):

Epilepsia, Vol. 43, No. 8, 2002

• Arrhythmic abnormalities including sinus arrhyth-
mia, sinus pause, premature atrial depolarization
(PAD), premature ventricular complex (PVC), ir-
regular rhythm (wandering pacemaker, multifocal
atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation), asystole or par-
oxysmal tachycardia. Sinus arrhythmia was defined
as an inspiratory increase in heart rate by >50% (2).
We defined a sinus pause as a clearly visible de-
layed sinus beat, where the following beat is exactly
in line with the original rhythm and there is no other
visible irregularity in heart rhythm. An asystole is
defined as a period without heart beat nor p wave
lasting at least 3 seconds.

• Conduction abnormalities including AV-block and
bundle branch block (QRS-complex widening of
more than 0.12 s).

• Repolarization abnormalities: T wave inversion and
ST-elevation or depression (equivalent to >2 mm).

Risk Factors for ECG Abnormalities

Along with patient’s details (age and gender) the fol-
lowing seizure variables were documented: (i) seizure
duration, (ii) state before seizure (sleeping, lying awake
or active), (iii) clinical seizure type (electrographic with
no clear clinical manifestation, partial or secondarily
generalized), (iv) localization of electrographic seizure
onset.

These variables were investigated to determine their
relationships to the occurrence of ECG abnormalities.
Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t
test, Chi squared, and where appropriate, the Fisher Ex-
act test (for Chi squared analyses, if two expected cell
frequencies were less than five then no analysis was
performed). Because a variable number of seizures per
patient was analyzed, we selected only the first seizure
per variable per patient for categoric data analysis (Chi
square test, Fisher’s Exact test) or the average per patient
for continuous data (Student’s t test). For the patients
with abnormalities in some of their seizures, the average
was calculated for those seizures with abnormalities. A
paired t test was performed within patients with ECG
abnormalities in some of their seizures, to compare the
continuous data in the seizures with abnormalities and in
the seizures without abnormalities.

In the following results, we will discuss “percentage of
seizures” and “percentage of patients”; when stating that
“x% of patients” exhibited a certain abnormality, we
mean that the abnormality was present in at least one
seizure of these patients.

RESULTS

Of the 104 patients in the study, 23 had seizure-related
artifact that rendered the ECG uninterpretable. The re-
maining 81 patients had a total of 1499 seizures without
excessive artifact and we reviewed 281 of those (a mean

of 3.5 seizures per patient). Patient ages ranged from 11
to 64 yr. (mean 34 yr.) and 60% of the patients were
female. The average seizure duration was 58 s (SD: 47 s).
11% of seizures were electrographic, with no clear clini-
cal manifestation, 83% were partial and 6% secondarily
generalized. 40% of the seizures occurred at night.

Heart Rate

The average baseline heart rate was 78 beats/minute
(SD: 15 beats/minute). In 73% of seizures (93% of pa-
tients) there was an increase of more than 10 beats/
minute and 55% of seizures (80% of patients) had an
increase of more than 20 beats/minute. In 7% of seizures
(15% of patients) there was a decrease of more than 10
beats/minute. Figure 1 shows how these heart rate
changes relate to the electrographic and clinical seizure
onsets. The average time between the earliest epoch in
which the rate exceeded the baseline by more than 10
beats/minute and the earliest epoch in which the rate
exceeded the baseline by more than 20 beats/minute was
9 s (SD: 14).

It is interesting to note that while the heart rate
changes often occurred around the time of the electro-
graphic onset, they sometimes preceded this onset, and
often preceded the reported clinical onset. In 23% of
seizures (49% of patients) the heart rate change preceded
both the electrographic and the clinical onset. A heart
rate change was considered to precede a seizure onset
when the 6-second epoch during which the HR increased
started at least 3 seconds prior to onset. In 10 out of the
32 electrographic seizures the heart rate changed, while
no other clinical sign was reported (figure 2). In the

examples provided, it can also be seen that there was a
continued period of post ictal heart rate fluctuations.

ECG Abnormalities

There were six seizures with ECG abnormalities ex-
clusively in the pre-ictal period: sinus arrhythmia (five
seizures, three patients), PAD (one seizure). Four sei-
zures (three patients) had pre-ictal ECG abnormalities
that continued after seizure onset: three seizures (two pa-
tients) with sinus pauses and one with sinus arrhythmia.

There were 41 patients with ECG abnormalities during
or right after the end of a seizure, though in 13 of these
41 patients, some ECG abnormalities occurred not only
during seizures but were also found in the preictal period
as well as in the other interictal segments that were avail-
able for review: ST elevation/depression (three), AV-
block (two) and T wave inversion (eight). In some other
patients the abnormalities (mostly ST elevation/
depression) were visible in the interictal period, but were
more pronounced during or after the seizures. ECG ab-
normalities related to the seizure were most often found
in the ictal and postictal period and occurred in 73 sei-
zures (26%) and 36 patients (44%). Sinus arrhythmia,
PADs and sinus pauses were the most common abnor-
malities (table 1, figure 3). Potentially severe abnormali-
ties occurred in 29 seizures (11 patients) and one of these
was an asystole for 30 s (figure 4).

Risk factors

In table 2 the occurrence of ECG abnormalities in
relation to different variables is presented for all patients
while in table 3 only the seizures from those patients who
had abnormalities in some of their seizures are presented.

FIG. 1. Frequency histogram demonstrating the timing of heart rate changes compared to electrographic and clinical seizure onset,
when the heart rate decreases by 10 beats/minute or increases by 10 or 20 beats/minute. For 53 seizures, the electrographic onset was
unclear and these seizures were therefore excluded from the upper graph (a total of 183 seizures are represented), while the seizures
without clinical signs were excluded from the lower graph (a total of 218 seizures are represented). On average, the increase in heart rate
(by 10 beats/minute) preceded the electrographic onset by 1.1 s (SD: 17.1 s) and the clinical onset by 3.3 s (SD 14.1 s).

The duration of seizures with abnormalities is signifi-
cantly longer when seizures within patients with some
abnormalities are compared (one-tailed t (cid:1) 1.9, p (cid:1)
0.04); however, this did not reach statistical significance
when compared between patients (t (cid:1) 0.5, p (cid:1) 0.63).
Age (t (cid:1) −1.20, p (cid:1) 0.23) and gender ((cid:1)2 (cid:1) 1.61, p (cid:1)
0.20) did not influence the occurrence of ECG abnor-
malities. When selecting the first seizure per variable for
each patient, there were 17 electrographic seizures (12%
abnormalities), 73 partial seizures (25% abnormalities)
and 10 generalized seizures (30% abnormalities). ECG
abnormalities did not occur more during generalized sei-
zures (Fisher’s Exact test, p (cid:1) 0.61). The location of
seizure onset did not influence the occurrence of ECG
abnormalities. After selection, the onset was in the left
hemisphere in 32 seizures (31% abnormalities) and in the
right hemisphere in 30 seizures (20% abnormalities) ((cid:1)2
(cid:1) 1.0, p (cid:1) 0.31). 47 seizures had a temporal origin

difference in heart rate for seizures with abnormalities
compared to seizures without abnormalities between and
within patients was not significant for either the absolute
maximum rate (t (cid:1) 0.83, p (cid:1) 0.41; paired t (cid:1) 1.4, p (cid:1)
0.16) nor the relative change (t (cid:1) 1.5, p (cid:1) 0.13; paired
t (cid:1) 1.0, p (cid:1) 0.34).

DISCUSSION

Our main finding is that an increase in heart rate oc-
curs often at the time of epileptic seizures. Changes pre-
dominate around seizure onset, including before any
other clinical or electrographic sign. Sometimes an in-
crease in heart rate was found, while no other clinical
sign was seen. Seizure-related changes in heart rate are
characterized by a steep acceleration phase and wide
fluctuations during and immediately after the seizure;

these changes have been noted elsewhere (4). ECG re-
cordings are not always conducted or reviewed during
epilepsy monitoring and yet our results suggest that these
data can provide useful clinical information. Not only
may ECG rate changes precede any other clinical signs,
they may be the only clinical sign. As such they may
provide important information for classifying seizures as
“without clinical signs” or for determining the time
of first clinical manifestations. They also indicate in-
volvement of the autonomic nervous system in the con-
stellation of clinical symptomatology. Furthermore,
potentially dangerous ECG abnormalities occur more
frequently during seizures than in the interictal period
and the recording and assessment of this information
may be crucial in monitoring the risk of SUDEP.

ECG abnormalities were found to occur often and at
levels similar to that reported in other studies (1,2). We
found the statistically significant relationships between
seizure duration and ECG abnormalities that have been
identified elsewhere (1,2), though only when comparing
the seizures within patients with some abnormalities. Nei

FIG. 4. Asystole. Male patient (53 yr.) was asleep. First sign (00:00) was a facial movement that preceded the first electrographic change
by four seconds. There was a build up of 3 Hz activity recorded from the left temporal lobe with maximum amplitude in referential montage
at T3, T5, T9, P9 and Zy1. The heart rate slowed down right after seizure onset and from 00:22 until 00:52 there is an asystole of 30
seconds, after which the heart rate gradually increases. The EEG showed a generalized depression starting 15 seconds after asystole
onset and changed into a generalized 5 Hz rhythm 15 seconds after the heart regained function. Clinically, there was lip licking (00:07,
maximum at 00:25). At 00:44 the patient’s right arm became flaccid and he dropped it beside his body. He flexed his left arm and slightly
turned his head towards the right side (00:54). A noise coming from his throat was heard which could have resembled an attempt to cough.
At 01:09, brief clonic movements were seen in both arms also affecting the lower jaw. ECG: ECG1-ECG2.

et al. (2) and Opherk et al. (1) reported generalized sei-
zures as a main risk factor for ECG abnormalities. The
results of our study are not so clear but may reflect the
fact that we had fewer generalized seizures and the av-
erage seizure duration in our data set was shorter than
reported elsewhere (1,2). In our study the ECG recording
was not a priority during patient monitoring and this may
have resulted in a relatively high proportion of patients
with uninterpretable ECGs. Omitting these patients prob-
ably biased our data set slightly by removing a number of
patients with generalized seizures. Other studies did not
report on the proportion of patients for whom the ECG
was uninterpretable.

Compared to other studies, we found relatively more
patients with sinus arrhythmias and fewer patients with
ST elevations. These differences might be explained
partly by our assessment of several (instead of only one)
seizures per patient. Within one patient, the same ECG

abnormalities tend to occur in several of their seizures.
Because seizures were selected mostly from different
days, we cannot comment on ECG abnormalities in suc-
cessive seizures. Because the ECG is derived in only two
leads instead of using the usual 12-lead ECG, assessment
of elevation or depression of the ST segment and inver-
sion of T waves is not reliable. Therefore, when the
two-lead ECG suggests one of these potentially danger-
ous repolarization abnormalities, it is advisable to add
extra precordial ECG leads. Asystoles of 9 to 26 s as well
as fatal asystoles are reported in several case studies
(14–25). Scott et al. (17) report a prevalence of two
significant periods of asystole (13 and 15 s) out of more
than 1,500 complex seizures (589 patients). We found an
asystole for 30 seconds in one of 81 patients. Nei et al.
(2) found an asystole of 6.5 seconds out of 43 patients,
while Opherk et al. (1) found no asystole in 41 patients.
All patients were monitored as part of their evaluation

would suggest a prevalence of 0.5%.

Further study is indicated to explore how the seizure-
related ECG patterns can be integrated in clinical prac-
tice and can be used for automatic seizure detection.
Time-frequency analysis of R-R intervals revealed that
autonomic activation may precede clinical seizure onset
by several minutes (27). Analysis of inter-ictal heart rate
disclosed cases of continuous fluctuations in heart rate
during alert waking (28). For seizure detection, more
information regarding normal baseline fluctuations is
needed in order to determine if the rate changes seen

during seizures can be reliably differentiated from nor-
mal fluctuations. It has been proposed that an early heart
rate decrease is more probable in temporal lobe seizures
than in seizures of other origin (3). Another study how-
ever reported that a decrease was found only in frontal
lobe seizures, while an early rate increase occurred more
often in temporal lobe seizures (7). Epstein et al. (29)
concluded that ictal tachycardia depended on the volume
of cerebral structures that were recruited into the seizure.
As ECG detectors become available for implementation
during EEG monitoring, the pattern of heart rate changes
can be easily correlated to the changes on EEG and the
clinical manifestations. Further study towards the asso-
ciation between localization of seizure onset and seizure
spread and changes in heart rate may reveal another di-
agnostic value of heart rate changes. It is also possible
that different antiepileptic medications affect heart rate
and the ECG differently. Our patients were most often
taking several medications and this could be best as-
sessed on a patient population with a simpler drug regi-
men. Finally, these results were obtained in patients who
had most often a medically refractory epileptic disorder.
Their generalization to other patient populations would
require confirmation.

In conclusion, it is advisable to record the ECG in the
clinical evaluation of epileptic seizures. The ECG should
be reviewed for high-risk cardiac abnormalities during
seizures. A change in heart rate can be used as an extra
clinical sign and can be very informative with respect to
the first manifestation of the epileptic discharge.
