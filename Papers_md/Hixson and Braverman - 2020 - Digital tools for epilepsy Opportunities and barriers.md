1. Introduction

This review and commentary presents and discusses the major categories of digital tools that are currently
available to epilepsy patients. This review synthesizes the breadth of resources that may be used to create a
comprehensive self-management platform. The manuscript organizes the discussion into the following topics:
self-management education programs, electronic diaries for self-monitoring, and automated wearables for sei-
zure detection. Despite being available for many years, these tools are utilized by only a small fraction of
epilepsy patients. To directly address this, the discussion section will opine on some of the possible barriers,
including a lack of historical precedent or prescribing infrastructure, a lack of financial incentives, concerns
about data privacy or liability, and uncertainty about the supporting evidence for these solutions.

Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurologic conditions
in the United States, with approximately 3 million individuals diag-
nosed (Tian et al., 2018). This makes an epilepsy diagnosis the fourth
most common neurologic condition, ranking behind headache, stroke,
and dementia. In addition to the unpredictable seizures that define
epilepsy, there are a host of social, lifestyle, and workplace challenges
that detract from the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. For-
tunately, there are many FDA-approved medications, and these thera-
pies are effective at preventing seizures for the majority of patients.
However, there are a substantial number of patients who are not suc-
cessfully treated with medications; these patients may require more
advanced medication combination approaches, therapeutic devices, or
even surgical interventions to better manage their seizures. For all
epilepsy patients, regardless of treatment requirements, a robust plat-
form of care management tools, education, and social support is ne-
cessary to optimize the odds of success.

Historically, epilepsy patients sought out and received education
and disease management support through a mix of interactions, in-
cluding face-to-face discussions with nurses and physicians, paper-
based instructional materials, and patient-facing lectures or support
groups. Unfortunately, these resources are not ubiquitously available to
patients, due to a lack of widespread dissemination, the burden on
healthcare team time, and the resources necessary to create and update
content. The digital era has promised to dramatically increase the ac-
cessibility of these types of resources, both by lowering the cost and

intensity of creating content and by facilitating immediate on-demand
access for all types of patients. A so-called ‘techno-therapeutic’ ap-
proach would arm epilepsy patients with an optimized suite of educa-
tional and disease management tools to adjunctively support a tradi-
tional pharmaceutical or device-based treatment plan (Page et al.,
2018).

This review aims to present and discuss the major categories of
digital tools that are currently available to epilepsy patients. Although
prior review articles have focused on specific elements of digital solu-
tions, this review synthesizes the breadth of resources that may be used
to create a comprehensive and individualized self-management plat-
form. The review organizes the discussion into the following topics:
self-management education programs, electronic diaries for self-mon-
itoring, and automated wearables for seizure detection (Table 1).
Within these categories, individual interventions have been studied and
available to patients for years, but the evolution of a digital ‘ecosystem’
promises the potential to integrate these tools in a manner that can
meaningfully benefit patients’ health.

The manuscript will also present a commentary on the possible
concerns that are preventing more widespread adoption of these digital
health resources. Despite being available for many years, these tools are
broadly utilized by only a small fraction of epilepsy patients, depending
on the type of intervention (Page et al., 2018). Many of the discussed
programs and devices have been implemented in a research environ-
ment; however, the majority of comprehensive epilepsy centers do not
have a mechanism for disseminating or supporting these patient aids.
To directly address this, the discussion section will focus on some of the

barriers to adoption, including a lack of historical precedent and pre-
scribing infrastructure, a lack of financial incentives, concerns about
data privacy or liability, and a lack of consensus about the strength of
the supporting evidence for these solutions.

(DiIorio et al., 2011). This effort represented one of the first well-vali-
dated and critically assessed online platforms for delivering epilepsy
self-management content.

2. Patient education programs (self-management)

Patient education is an intuitive and important element of opti-
mizing self-care; the majority of healthcare providers impart some
education to patients and caregivers during visits. However, these dis-
cussions are usually informal, lack a structured ‘curriculum’, and may
not be reinforced with patients. Perhaps as a result of this, a number of
structured epilepsy self-management programs have been created and
rigorously tested to better facilitate patient education and empower-
ment (Table 1). Epilepsy self-management has been defined as the total
of steps taken and processes used by a person to maximize seizure
control and quality of life and to minimize the impact of having a sei-
zure disorder (DiIorio et al., 1996; Escoffery et al., 2018). A related
concept called self-efficacy has been defined as the ‘beliefs in one’s
capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to
produce given attainments’ (DiIorio et al., 2009). Patients who suc-
cessfully improve their self-efficacy through self-management practices
have been demonstrated to successfully complete self-care tasks, such
as taking medications and engaging in other healthy behaviors (DiIorio
et al., 2006). The importance of epilepsy self-management was high-
lighted in an Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2012 report (Epilepsy Across
the Spectrum), commenting on behavioral interventions to improve
health outcomes and the quality of life for epilepsy patients (Hesdorffer
et al., 2013).

Self-management practices are potentially valuable for all patients
with epilepsy but may be most beneficial for cohorts of patients who
require specific action plans. With improved recognition of urgent
epilepsy-related scenarios, such as seizure clustering, status epilepticus,
and SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy), there is an oppor-
tunity to empower patients and families to view a ‘seizure rescue plan’
as a formal element of a treatment paradigm (Smith et al., 2018;
Fleeman and Bradley, 2018; Cole and Gaspar, 2015). Although seizure
planning is but a single element of a comprehensive self-management
curriculum, this feature may serve as a ‘gateway’ to additional patient
engagement.

Formal self-management programs for epilepsy have been studied
and implemented for decades. The initial programs primarily utilized
in-person, curriculum-based sessions (either individual or group) to
provide patient education about epilepsy management (Helgeson et al.,
1990; May and Pfäfflin, 2002; Aliasgharpour and Dehgahn Nayeri,
2013). The reported results from these studies demonstrated successful
improvements in disease knowledge, self-management, and elements of
epilepsy-specific tracking. However, these initial programs were labor-
intensive, requiring staff moderation and in-person attendance by pa-
tients. More recent self-management programs have incorporated
formal peer support elements (Laybourne et al., 2015; Fraser et al.,
2015). And, a growing number of epilepsy self-management programs
include a digital platform. This approach serves to increase access,
convenience, and usability for many patients who may be unable to
travel long distances or commit the in-person time necessary to parti-
cipate in intensive educational sessions.

2.1. WebEase

One of the first programs to implement this digital strategy was the
WebEase platform (www.webease.org) (DiIorio et al., 2011). The We-
bEase tool includes three educational modules (medication adherence,
sleep, and stress) that can be completed online. The original clinical
trial successfully demonstrated improvements in epilepsy self-efficacy,
self-reported adherence, self-management, and stress levels in an in-
tervention patient group compared with a wait-list control group

2.2. Managing epilepsy well (MEW)

In concert with the WebEase program, an online hub resource,
hosted through the Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) network (mana-
gingepilepsywell.org) currently provides comprehensive digital re-
sources for epilepsy patients. In addition to WebEase, a variety of other
digital self-management programs have been made available, each with
a slightly different clinical focus for patients. For instance, the PEARLS
and UPLIFT (managingepilepsywell.org/uplift) programs are focused
on improving depression and quality of life in epilepsy, while the
HOBSCOTCH program aims to assist with memory difficulties (Chen
et al., 2018). The MINDSET program (managingepilepsywell.org/
mindset) is a digital clinical-decision support system that aims to
identify a patient’s specific self-management challenges and subse-
quently craft an individualized educational program (Shegog and
Begley, 2017). Currently, each of these programs is generally only
available at dedicated epilepsy centers; however, the MEW Network
model is intended to develop greater awareness to fuel better dis-
semination.

2.3. Peer support networks

available

to patients

In addition to formal self-management programs, peer support has
increasingly become recognized as a valuable resource for many patients.
The WebEase platform has incorporated a social networking peer com-
ponent to its suite of tools, and there are now multiple online peer support
networks
(www.patientslikeme.com, www.
myepilepsyteam.com, www.epilepsy.com/forum-topics). Integrated, on-
line peer support was a fundamental part of a self-management study
published in 2015, which examined the use of an online and mobile
platform in US Veterans with epilepsy (Hixson et al., 2015). This platform
included self-tracking tools and formal educational videos, but also in-
cluded a dedicated epilepsy-specific online peer
forum (www.
patientslikeme.com/conditions/epilepsy). The study used the same out-
comes measures as in prior self-management studies, demonstrating a
statistically significant improvement in epilepsy self-management and self-
efficacy after six weeks of unmoderated use of the platform (Hixson et al.,
2015). Unlike most of the formal self-management programs, this study
employed a pragmatic trial design, highlighting the value of these re-
sources in a real-world setting.

3. Data capture (self-monitoring)

Although often discussed separately from self-management topics,
the use of trackable data metrics is an increasingly critical element of
optimizing epilepsy care. It is well known that patients have difficulty
with accurate seizure recall, either due to the nature of an individual’s
seizure types or simple recall bias (Fisher et al., 2012; Fisher, 2017).
Additionally, medication adherence remains a challenge for many pa-
tients, with even a single missed or improperly timed dose potentially
leading to a seizure (Paschal et al., 2014). Digital tools for improved
data capture can potentially aid a patient to better manage their
treatment and can create a more accurate data set for helping both
healthcare providers and patients make more informed decisions.

Mobile diaries are one category of self-monitoring solution that has
been available for many years. Some of the original electronic diaries
were effectively digital recreations of paper-based tools (Fisher et al.,
2012). However, more recent versions of electronic diaries have been
upgraded to include better usability with more efficient mechanisms for
seizure reporting, medication entry, and personalized reminders
(Table 1). A number of mobile applications on different operating
platforms are available, although most are commercial products that

3

J.D. Hixson and L. Braverman

Epilepsy Research 162 (2020) 106233

have not been critically studied (Page et al., 2018; Escoffery et al.,
2018; Fisher et al., 2012; Pandher and Bhullar, 2016). Recent reviews
have identified a large and growing number of epilepsy-specific mobile
applications, with most being free and easily accessible (Escoffery et al.,
2018; Pandher and Bhullar, 2016). However, a smaller number of these
applications were designed specifically for patient management, with
the most common features being seizure and medication tracking
(Escoffery et al., 2018).

Overall, despite a large number of mobile diaries, there is a need for
more comprehensive inclusion of self-management and patient educa-
tion in these applications (Escoffery et al., 2018). Most are only focused
on tracking tools, and do not incorporate proven self-management
programs into a single cost-effective and efficient resource. This re-
presents an incredible opportunity for new and existing programs to
either build self-management and seizure action planning programs
into their platforms or establish easy-to-navigate links to existing hubs,
such as the Managing Epilepsy Well network (Shegog et al., 2013;
Sajatovic et al., 2017; Begley et al., 2018).

One of the better-known mobile diaries is the product supported by
the Epilepsy Foundation, My Seizure Diary (diary.epilepsy.com) (Fisher
et al., 2015). The latest version of the My Seizure Diary includes a more
efficient, notification-based method for reporting seizures and includes
customizable reminders for seizure monitoring, medication dosing, and
refills (dairy.epilepsy.com). Earlier versions of the My Seizure Diary
have been successfully used in several clinical trials for capturing self-
reported data (de Ernst et al., 2016; Meador et al., 2018), and the diary
is currently being used in a prospective research program for tracking
seizures. Seizuretracker is another popular mobile and online diary
option with self-tracking capabilities, including advanced graphing
features that display potential correlations between seizure frequency,
side effects, and medication changes (www.seizuretracker.com) (Fisher
et al., 2012). Yet another epilepsy-specific diary is the EpiDiary (www.
epidiary.com) which also offers seizure tracking, medication adherence
data, and advanced graphing and report features. EpiDiary is also
available in multiple languages, making it potentially attractive for
individual patients and caregivers
international users. Ultimately,
should explore each diary offering, and choose the ones that works best
for their needs.

4. Wearable devices

While mobile diaries have improved in usability in recent years,
many patients still have difficulties with self-reporting mechanisms
(Pandher and Bhullar, 2016; Fisher et al., 2015; Blachut et al., 2015,
2017). The advent of wearable technologies has raised the possibility of
in-
‘automated’ seizure detection and even medication adherence,
dependent of patient self-report. While the majority of consumer de-
vices have not been validated for epilepsy patients, a small cohort of
products have been specifically designed and tested for this purpose
(Table 1). As a group, these wearables provide potential benefit for
seizure monitoring (particularly convulsions) for patients at risk of
serious consequences such as SUDEP (Gutierrez et al., 2018; Ryvlin
et al., 2018; Picard et al., 2017). These wearables utilize a variety of
peripheral biometric signals that are often associated with certain types
including accelerometry, gyroscopy, electromyography,
of seizures,
heart rate variability, and electrodermal skin responses (Ramgopal
et al., 2014; Reeder and David, 2016; van Andel et al., 2016, 2017;
Dumanis et al., 2017; Ryvlin and Beniczky, 2018; Arends, 2018).

4.1. Smartwatch

One of the first medical-grade wearables for automated seizure
detection was the Smartwatch wearable by Smartmonitor, with the first
generation available in 2010 (Lockman et al., 2011). The wrist worn
device performs automated seizure detection based exclusively on ac-
celerometry and gyroscopic data, and in early testing, it demonstrated

favorable sensitivity for detecting convulsive seizure types (Lockman
et al., 2011). Later studies demonstrated more modest detection per-
formance (Patterson et al., 2015), but the device still appears to have
utility for detecting convulsive events (Velez et al., 2016). Subsequent
versions of the device have improved the performance, and have in-
corporated other ancillary features, including a mobile app with event
tracking, alerting for caregivers, and GPS localization (www.smart-
monitor.com). Other wearables devices have also leveraged the detec-
tion abilities of accelerometry. This includes an EpiCare device (da-
nishcare.co.uk/epicare-free), which has been tested and validated in
video-EEG monitoring settings (Beniczky et al., 2013; Meritam et al.,
2018), similar to the Smartwatch.

4.2. Apple watch

In terms of more consumer-grade wearables, the Apple Watch is the
most prominent entrant into the medical space. Using accelerometry
and gyroscopic data, the movement detection features of the Apple
Watch are compelling for a consumer device, and the Watch is currently
being used in a patient-driven research study on automated seizure
detection (paired with a mobile application) (www.hopkinsmedicine.
org/epiwatch). However, this effort does not represent the same level of
critical validation that has been performed on some of the other
wearables for seizure detection. Thus, it remains unclear how the Apple
Watch would be integrated into a self-management platform for epi-
lepsy patients.

4.3. Brain sentinel

Another epilepsy-specific wearable is the Brain Sentinel device
(brainsentinel.com) (Ryvlin and Beniczky, 2018; Szabó et al., 2015;
Halford et al., 2017). This device is usually worn on the upper arm over
the biceps muscle and uses electromyography (EMG) signals to auto-
mate convulsive seizure detection. This wearable has also been tested
and validated in video-EEG monitoring environments, demonstrating
good sensitivity for detecting generalized tonic-clonic convulsions
(Szabó et al., 2015; Halford et al., 2017). As with the other wearables,
the evidence for the accurate detection of other seizure types is more
limited (Szabó et al., 2015; Halford et al., 2017). However, for con-
vulsive seizure quantification and alerting, the Brain Sentinel product
may be a useful option for some patients.

4.4. EDA devices

The electrodermal skin response (EDA) is the final, notable bio-
metric that has garnered much attention for seizure detection; this
approach is essentially a skin-generated electrical signal that indicates
the relative activity of the autonomic nervous system (Poh et al., 2010).
Research in this area has demonstrated that the EDA response can be
dramatic during a convulsive seizure event (Poh et al., 2010; Sarkis
et al., 2015). The Embrace wrist worn device, developed by Empatica
(www.empatica.com), has leveraged the use of EDA signaling in com-
bination with traditional accelerometry information to bring a more
multi-modal approach to automated seizure detection. Validation stu-
dies have successfully demonstrated a high degree of sensitivity for
convulsive seizures (Poh et al., 2010, 2012; Onorati et al., 2017). The
device has also performed reasonably well for the detection of other
seizure types, but may not be optimized for event detection outside of
convulsions. In addition to the Embrace device, Empatica also produces
a ‘research-grade’ device (the E4), which adds heart rate variability and
skin temperature to the list of possible peripheral biometrics that could
be added to a composite detection methodology. Finally, it is also no-
teworthy that the Empatica wearables are paired with a mobile appli-
cation (the Mate app) that is capable of capturing data for self-tracking.

4.5. Multimodal devices

Recent reviews of the wearable space for automated seizure detec-
tion have confirmed the trend towards a multimodal approach to bio-
metric monitoring (van Andel et al., 2017; Leijten, 2018; Elger and
Hoppe, 2018). This is perhaps due to the inherent sensitivity limitations
of devices with detections based on single biometric signals (Elger and
Hoppe, 2018), or due to the individual variability in seizure semi-
ologies. Understandably, a composite detection algorithm utilizing
multiple biometrics likely promises a higher sensitivity and specificity
(Elger and Hoppe, 2018). Further, for individual patients, a persona-
lized detection algorithm may promise the highest accuracy of all. This
could potentially be tailored during a baseline video-EEG monitoring
session to capture representative seizures, while multiple wearable
biometrics are assessed. This approach has not yet been fully studied,
but may represent a potential workflow for the future.

5. Digital therapeutics

Other epilepsy therapeutic devices include the vagal nerve stimu-
lator (VNS), responsive neurostimulator system (RNS), and the deep
brain stimulator (DBS). Of these, the RNS captures real-time and on-
going seizure quantification data for physician and healthcare team
planning, but also features an associated web app (myseizurediary.com)
that provides tools for individual seizure tracking. This data can be
exported and shared with others. The VNS and DBS devices are not
associated with independent patient-facing electronic diaries; however,
the settings data for these systems can be entered and tracked on other
diaries such as the My Seizure Diary and Seizuretracker. All of these
therapeutic devices are capable of capturing important epilepsy-related
metrics but are not yet fully compatible with or automatically in-
tegrated into the most popular mobile diaries. This highlights the po-
tential opportunity to improve the relationship between more tradi-
tional
interventions and emerging comprehensive self-
treatment
management platforms.

6. Discussion

As presented here, a proliferation of patient-facing adjunctive tools
have been developed and studied for the management of epilepsy. This
includes categories of intensive self-management programs (both non-
digital and digital), mobile electronic diaries, and wearable technolo-
gies. Individually, these tools may add value to traditional treatment
approaches, depending on the needs, interest, and engagement of the
patient. While many commercial-facing applications (mostly in the
mobile diary category) have not been critically evaluated, more high
profile and intensive programs and devices have been validated scien-
tifically, and demonstrated to provide some clinical benefit. Many of
these resources have evolved or been iterated to reflect changing
technological capabilities or the needs and desires of patients and
healthcare teams; thus, the value of these tools is likely to improve.

However, the widespread adoption of these resources as a whole
remains limited in the field of epilepsy, particularly in relationship to
the utilization of similar programs for diseases such as diabetes and
asthma (Helmers et al., 2017). Thus, a commentary would not be
complete without a discussion of the potential reasons behind this
slowed adoption and identifiable barriers to implementation (Page
et al., 2018; Helmers et al., 2017; Crooks et al., 2017; Ozanne et al.,
2018; Johansson et al., 2018). These concerns and barriers span the
entirety of the healthcare ecosystem, including patient perceptions and
experiences, physician and healthcare team behaviors and incentives,
and broader infrastructure and policy issues, particularly in the United
States. This discussion is not meant to represent an exhaustive list of
concerns, but rather reflects the authors’ observations of common
barriers that were observed during the review of the literature.

From a patient perspective, a simple lack of awareness (Escoffery

Epilepsy Research 162 (2020) 106233

et al., 2018; Atkinson-Clark et al., 2018) and introduction to these tools
is often the greatest barrier. While some patients do naturally seek out
educational resources and assistive tools, many do not; additionally, it
can be challenging to identify credible and appropriate sources for
content. Thus, many patients and caregivers are left with a feeling of
isolation and questioning after a medical appointment.

Digital tools also face problems of usability and nonadherence, just
as with medications and other traditional therapeutics. Patients may
not complete or understand the concept self-management programs.
(Perzynski et al., 2017). The current wearables require a significant
degree of patient or caregiver maintenance, and face some of the same
challenges as daily medication regimens (Meritam et al., 2018). Many
epilepsy patients may have psychiatric or medical comorbidities that
limit their ability to use more intensive programs (including self-man-
agement modules, diary interfaces, and wearables) (Perzynski et al.,
2017), even though they would benefit from these services.

Patients and caregivers may justifiably by concerned about data
quality and accuracy, since this information will be used for ongoing
management decisions (Leenen et al., 2016). Patients report needing to
establish a certain level of trust with their healthcare team in order to
feel comfortable with the safety of these tools and the use of this data to
inform treatment plans (Perzynski et al., 2017);Schachter, 2017). Ad-
ditionally, patients with epilepsy may continue to feel a certain degree
of stigma through the use of these tools. For instance, many of the
wearables described earlier are larger, require more maintenance, or
appear more unique than traditional consumer products, and patients
may feel uneasy about the public display of these devices (Baker et al.,
2018).

The healthcare team also plays a pivotal role in the education, im-
plementation, and adoption of these ancillary tools. A perceived lack of
communication with providers and healthcare team members is fre-
quently reported as a barrier to understanding health conditions and
utilizing available tools for epilepsy self-management (Perzynski et al.,
2017; Schachter, 2017). Incorporating systematic patient education
programs can be challenging, and can often require years of efforts,
even with the use of certain incentives. Nonetheless, physician and
healthcare team ‘championing’ of these resources is often critical for
success (Helmers et al., 2017).

Additionally, many of the mobile applications for epilepsy have
never been critically assessed and are largely the domain of the con-
sumer-facing environment (Escoffery et al., 2018). As such, physicians
may feel unprepared to judge the quality of the program, leading them
to defer on making recommendations. Even for tools that have been
critically evaluated, physicians may be unimpressed with or skeptical of
the magnitude of the effectiveness (Leenen et al., 2014). Even with
epilepsy wearables, which have demonstrated consistently strong sen-
sitivity for detecting convulsions, physicians may still not appreciate
the beneficial effects of these tools or which patients would be most
appropriate for their use.

From a logistical perspective, the lack of an existing prescription
model and financial reimbursement system also impedes progress in the
digital health space. This situation also plagued the greater tele-
medicine market for years, slowing adoption (although this has begun
to change) (Dorsey et al., 2018). For many of the programs described in
this review, particularly self-management courses and mobile diaries,
the costs to the individual and healthcare system are extremely low.
Therefore, the primary barrier to a prescription model is the lack of an
efficient prescribing infrastructure in the daily workflow of physicians
(Helmers et al., 2017; Perzynski et al., 2017), not necessarily a pure
financial disincentive.

There are a number of possible solutions to address these concerns,
many of which are already being discussed within the epilepsy com-
munity. Newer versions of mobile applications and self-management
programs have been refined to be more user-friendly, with recognition
of the time requirements of routine data reporting. Marketing cam-
paigns have been launched to increase patient awareness of self-

5

J.D. Hixson and L. Braverman

Epilepsy Research 162 (2020) 106233

management programs, and Internet ‘hubs’ now exist where patients
can access multiple resources. However, awareness is still lacking, and
more resources should be devoted to increasing patient and caregiver
engagement. Patients should feel compelled to inquire with their phy-
sicians and healthcare teams about these resources, just as they would
inquire about new medications or surgical techniques.

In terms of an evidence-base, for those interventions with suppor-
tive academic research, both patient- and provider-facing educational
resources should be created to better inform the broader epilepsy
community. Where lacking or limited, more efforts should be led to
fund and conduct large-scale randomized, controlled trials that could
generate more traditional evidence, potentially even supporting a reg-
ulatory approval pathway. Admittedly, some of these interventions are
likely not suitable for this approach, but in those cases, pragmatic, real-
world study designs could still be helpful in generating evidence of
benefit.

On the healthcare team side, ‘at risk’ patients should be identified
for self-management and mobile tools; this could include patients who
are medically-refractory, those with a high seizure burden or risk of
SUDEP, or those with psychological comorbidities such as depression or
anxiety. Clinical decision support systems could be created to assist
physicians in determining which tools might be most appropriate for
certain patients, and these tools could be integrated into existing EMRs.
A physician would ideally be able to create a formal prescription at the
end of a clinical encounter, linked to the EMR or at a minimum, with a
transmission feature to the patient. A non-physician member of the
healthcare team could also meet with these patients after the formal
clinic visit to review recommendations and aid the patients with set-up
and registration. The primary aim of this proposal would be to funda-
mentally lower the barrier for physician-recommended distribution of
educational and supportive materials, creating a more formal system of
approval for patients (Schachter, 2017).

Given the review presented here and the preceding discussion on
barriers to implementation, it is apparent that a call to action is needed
within the epilepsy community. These emerging digital technologies of
all forms are rapidly improving in quality and effectiveness, and yet
they rarely fit within the traditional ecosystem of medical practice.
Therefore, all members of this clinical community are challenged to
innovatively develop and practice new solutions that will speed adop-
tion of these tools and ultimately improve the longitudinal self-care of
epilepsy patients.
