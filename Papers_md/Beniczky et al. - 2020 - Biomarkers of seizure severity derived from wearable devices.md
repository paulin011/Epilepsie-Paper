Abstract
Besides  triggering  alarms,  wearable  seizure  detection  devices  record  a  variety  of 

biosignals  that  represent  biomarkers  of  seizure  severity.  There  is  a  need  for  auto-

mated seizure characterization, to identify high-risk seizures. Wearable devices can 

automatically identify seizure types with the highest associated morbidity and mor-

tality (generalized tonic-clonic seizures), quantify their duration and frequency, and 

provide data on postictal position and immobility, autonomic changes derived from 

electrocardiography/heart  rate  variability,  electrodermal  activity,  respiration,  and 

oxygen saturation. In this review, we summarize how these biosignals reflect seizure 

severity, and how they can be monitored in the ambulatory outpatient setting using 

wearable  devices.  Multimodal  recording  of  these  biosignals  will  provide  valuable 

information for individual risk assessment, as well as insights into the mechanisms 

and prevention of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

|  INTRODU CT ION

Several wearable, noninvasive seizure detection devices have 
been validated in large scale, phase 2-4 clinical trials.1,2 The 
primary aim of these devices was to provide seizure alarms, 
in order to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with 
seizures, and to quantify seizure burden.2 Wearable devices 
record biosignals for ultralong periods in the ambulatory out-
patient setting.2 Hence, besides alarms, they provide a unique 
opportunity for objective characterization of seizure severity, 

using  the  continuously  recorded  biomarkers.  These  data 
could help clinicians in better risk assessment, provide large 
datasets for improved understanding of morbidity and mor-
tality associated with seizures, especially sudden unexpected 
death in epilepsy (SUDEP),3 and help in selecting high-risk 
patients for clinical studies aimed at preventing SUDEP.4

Seizure severity can be characterized by the type, duration, 
frequency, and intensity of seizures, as well as by surrogate 
markers  associated  with  SUDEP,  such  as  postictal  general-
ized  electroencephalographic  (EEG)  suppression  (PGES),5

postictal  immobility,6  and  peri-ictal  autonomic  changes.7 
Biosignals associated with these features can be readily mea-
sured with noninvasive wearable devices. Although most of 
these biosignals are derived from the ictal and postictal peri-
ods, measurements in the preictal and even interictal periods 
might provide important information for algorithms aimed at 
prevention of injuries and SUDEP. In this paper, we review 
how seizure severity can be objectively characterized using 
biomarkers  measurable  with  noninvasive  wearable  devices 
(Figure 1).

CHARACTER IZ ATION  OF  SEI Z UR E 
T YPE AND FR EQU ENC Y

The most severe seizure types are the generalized tonic-clonic 
seizures (GTCSs), including the focal to bilateral tonic-clonic 
seizures  (formerly  known  as  secondarily  generalized  tonic-
clonic seizures), with the highest morbidity and mortality as-
sociated with seizures. Each year, 60% of the patients with 
GTCSs experience some accidental injury related to a GTCS 
and 25% experience at least one serious injury, causing inca-
pacitation  or  requiring  hospitalization  or  surgical  interven-
tion.8 Patients with five or more GTCSs per year had an odds 
ratio for injuries 3.5 times higher than patients with only one 
seizure per year.8 GTCS is the main risk factor of SUDEP. 
All video-EEG documented cases of SUDEP occurred after a 
GTCS.9 Experiencing a GTCS during the preceding year was 
associated with a 27-fold increased risk of SUDEP, whereas 
no excess risk was seen in those with exclusively non-GTCS 
seizures.10  The  combination  of  not  sharing  a  bedroom  and 
having at least one GTCS per year had a 67-fold increased 
risk of SUDEP.10 The SUDEP risk increases in association 
with increasing frequency of GTCS occurrence.11

Patients’ and families’ reports on GTCS occurrence suffer 
a number of important limitations, which further justify the 
development  of  GTCS-detection  devices.  First,  in  patients 
sleeping alone who are at highest risk for SUDEP, nocturnal 
GTCSs might remain unnoticed when none of the following 
inconstant  features  are  observed:  urination,  tongue  biting, 
and severe post-ictal myalgias. Second, many motor seizures 
are falsely regarded as GTCSs, including focal bilateral tonic 
seizures  involving  the  supplementary  motor  area,  the  pari-
etal cortex, or the insula. Third, fine analysis of GTCS has 
revealed  different  patterns,12  one  of  which  (type  1),  with 
symmetric bilateral extension of upper limbs during the tonic 
phase of GTCS, was significantly associated with the occur-
rence of PGES, a finding confirmed by others.13

Phase  3  and  4  clinical  validation  studies  showed  that 
wearable  devices  detect  GTCSs  with  a  high  sensitivity 
(90%-96%),  based  on  accelerometry,14,15  surface  elec-
tromyography,16  or  multimodal  biosignals.17  Algorithms 

Key Points

•  Wearable  devices  monitor  various  biosignals  for 
ultralong  periods  in  the  ambulatory  outpatient 
setting

•  Biomarkers of seizure severity can be determined 

from automated analysis of biosignals

•  These include type, frequency, and duration of the 
seizures,  postictal  position  and  immobility,  and 
autonomic changes

•  Wearable  devices  can  provide  valuable  data  for 
individual  risk  assessment,  understanding  of  the 
pathophysiology, and prevention of SUDEP

specific for GTCSs have been reported, accurately differen-
tiating between GTCSs and convulsive psychogenic nonep-
ileptic seizures.18,19 However, a significant number of false 
alarms occur with these devices (0.2-0.7/d).2 Therefore, the 
specificity of the detections needs further confirmation for 
accurate  quantification  of  the  GTCS  burden.  This  can  be 
achieved by user interaction (patients or caregivers cancel-
ling  false  alarms)  or  by  ulterior,  visual  assessment  of  the 
recorded  biosignals  by  experts.20,21  This  hybrid  method, 
consisting  in  offline,  expert  evaluation  of  biosignals  re-
corded during automatically detected events, seems to be a 
reliable way of quantifying the burden of GTCSs.

Fortunately,  only  a  minority  of  patients  with  frequent 
GTCSs  will  die  of  SUDEP.22  The  annual  SUDEP  risk  of 
patients with ≥3 GTCSs/y, extrapolated from the combina-
tion  of  epidemiology  and  case-control  studies,  is  estimated 
to  be  between  0.5  and  1.8/100  patient-years.9  Hence,  there 
is a need for recording further biosignals to stratify the more 
severe (potentially fatal) GTCSs.

EEG SUPP RESSION

Postictal cerebral (and possibly brainstem) shutdown is a pu-
tative mechanism causing SUDEP.3 PGES is a hallmark of 
this phenomenon, and it is defined as the immediate postic-
tal  (within  30  seconds)  generalized  absence  of  EEG  activ-
ity  >10  μV  in  amplitude,  allowing  for  muscle,  movement, 
breathing,  and  electrode  artifacts.5  Prolonged  PGES  may 
be  an  independent  risk  biomarker  for  SUDEP.5  However, 
another  study  did  not  find  significant  differences  in  PGES 
between 17 SUDEP cases and the matched controls,23 sug-
gesting that additional factors are needed for development of 
SUDEP.  Identification  and  measurement  of  PGES  requires 
scalp EEG array, which is not yet feasible for ultralong re-
cordings in the ambulatory outpatient setting. Nevertheless, it

F I G U R E   1  Biomarkers of seizure severity recorded with wearable devices. This infographic summarizes the biosignals reflecting seizure 
severity, measured with wearable devices, during the interictal, ictal, and postictal periods. ECG, electrocardiogram; EDA, electrodermal activity; 
EMG, electromyographic; GTCS, generalized tonic-clonic seizure; HRV, heart rate variability

can serve as a surrogate marker of seizure severity for inves-
tigating associations with biosignals recorded from wearable 
devices in explorative studies conducted in epilepsy monitor-
ing units (EMUs).

PHASES

The  duration  of  GTCS  is  also  a  measure  of  seizure  severity. 
GTCSs longer than 5 minutes are diagnostic for convulsive status 
epilepticus, a potentially life-threatening condition.24 Irreversible 
neuronal injury may occur after 30 minutes of convulsive seizure 
activity, as demonstrated by animal and human studies.24

GTCS  duration  can  be  automatically  determined 
from  biosignals  recorded  with  wearable  devices  by  sur-
face  electromyography  (EMG)21,25  and  accelerometry.26 
Furthermore,  EMG-based  algorithms  can  measure  dura-
tion of the tonic and of the clonic phases21,25 and parame-
ters derived from the bursts in the clonic phase (durations 
of the clonic bursts, the silent periods that separate them 
and the dynamics of their evolution–slope of their devel-
opment  in  time).27  These  EMG  parameters  were  signifi-
cantly  correlated  with  the  duration  of  the  PGES,  and  an 
EMG-based algorithm identified seizures with prolonged 
PGES with an accuracy of 85%.27

In a recent study, seizures with postictal tonic EMG ac-
tivity (measured at the EEG electrodes) were associated with 
longer  durations  of  PGES,  as  well  as  a  greater  severity  of 
respiratory  dysfunction,  thus  being  another  potential  bio-
marker for SUDEP.28 Tonic EMG activity following bilateral 
tonic-clonic seizures is associated with peri-ictal respiratory 
dysfunction and PGES.28

Among  the  16  monitored  SUDEP  cases  in  which  the  posi-
tion of the patient could be assessed, 14 (87.5%) were in a 
prone position at the time of the postictal cardiorespiratory 
arrest.9  A  nationwide  case-control  population-based  cohort 
study in Sweden showed that 82% of the SUDEP cases were 
in a prone position.29 Postictal immobility is believed to play 
an important role in SUDEP due to the lack of normal arousal 
mechanisms that prevent the patient from reflex reposition-
ing from a prone position after a GTCS, adding to the already 
present respiratory dysfunction. Several studies demonstrated 
that postictal immobility was associated with PGES and with 
postictal respiratory dysfunctions.30–33

Body position sensors are widely used in sleep medicine. 
Quantification of the mobility can easily be achieved using 
accelerometers, gyroscopes, EMG, or automated video anal-
ysis. Including these modalities into wearable epilepsy mon-
itoring and seizure detection devices could provide valuable 
information on the postictal prone position and immobility. 
When  present  after  a  GTCS,  these  would  indicate  an  in-
creased risk of SUDEP.

Ictal  and  postictal  autonomic  changes  are  well  documented. 
Early postictal cardiorespiratory dysfunctions leading to apnea 
and  cardiac  arrest  were  observed  in  all  monitored  SUDEP 
cases.9  Although  ictal  sinus  tachycardia  is  more  common,34

ictal and postictal bradycardia and asystole (occasionally fol-
lowed by tachyarrhythmia) seem to be more severe conditions, 
being observed in patients with SUDEP and near SUDEP.9,35–37
Heart  rate  variability  (HRV)  measures  in  patients  who 
later  died  of  SUDEP  suggested  a  significant  decrease38–41 
or  increase35,39  in  the  parasympathetic  activity  (root  mean 
square of successive differences) during the interictal period. 
The  postictal  decrease  in  parasympathetic  activity  and  in-
crease in sympathetic activity were correlated with PGES.42–
44  Postictal  mean  heart  rate  (a  combination  of  sympathetic 
increase and parasympathetic decrease) was an independent 
predictor  of  PGES,  suggesting  that  this  could  be  a  useful 
parameter  for  monitoring  severity  in  the  postictal  period.44 
Using automated R-peak detection algorithms,45 these HRV 
parameters  can  be  recorded  with  wearable  electrocardio-
graphic (ECG) devices originally designed for seizure detec-
tion.46,47 In addition, ECG monitoring in patients at risk can 
provide valuable information on cardiac repolarization anom-
alies (prolonged or shortened QTc interval), which have been 
suggested to contribute to the development of SUDEP.35,48

Electrodermal  activity  depends  on  the  state  of  the  sweat 
glands,  and  it  is  an  indicator  of  the  sympathetic  activity. 
Electrodermal  activity  (EDA)  increases  significantly  upon 
seizure onset in 73% of GTCSs and persists for 13 minutes, 
extending  into  the  postictal  period.26  In  a  case  of  SUDEP, 
an  unusual,  fast  rising,  and  large  postictal  EDA  was  docu-
mented, significantly exceeding the values measured during 
nonfatal  GTCSs.49  The  postictal  increase  in  EDA  was  sig-
nificantly  correlated  with  PGES.42,50  EDA  can  be  recorded 
by wearable wristband seizure detection devices.26,49,51 EDA 
provides insight into the autonomic changes during the ictal 
period of GTCS, when measuring HRV is unreliable due to 
artifacts.  Wearable  devices  measuring  EDA  yield  valuable 
information  on  seizure  severity  by  quantifying  the  sympa-
thetic changes in the ictal and postictal periods of GTCS.

Ictal  and  postictal  apnea  are  associated  with  severe  hypox-
emia (SpO2 < 75%).52 Following the hyperventilation at the 
end  of  GTCS,  early  postictal  apnea  was  documented  in  all 
monitored SUDEP case, with onset between 25 and 180 sec-
onds postictally (median = 118 seconds).9 Terminal apnea al-
ways preceded terminal asystole.9 Hypoxemia was associated 
with PGES.53–55 Wearable health devices used for monitor-
ing of physiological changes during various physical activi-
ties  include  those  measuring  capillary  oxygen  saturation.56 
Respiration sensors, like the ones used in polysomnography 

recordings,  seem  to  be  less  feasible  for  ultralong-term  am-
bulatory  use.  However,  respiration  rate  can  be  estimated 
from  subtle  respiration-induced  body  movements  recorded 
from  wristband  accelerometer  devices.49  Although  this  res-
piration estimator is unreliable during strong movements (ie, 
ictal period), it works during low-movement postictal periods 
and  it  has  documented  postictal  unusually  irregular  breath-
ing pattern and respiratory cessation in a case of SUDEP.49 
Wearable devices monitoring oxygen saturation and respira-
tion  can  provide  essential  information  about  severe,  poten-
tially life-threatening postictal changes.

|  THE SEVERIT Y  ST UDY

Although  many  wearable  biosignals  have  the  potential  to 
characterize the severity of GTCS, it appears desirable to de-
termine  a  cost-effective  solution  that  would  offer  maximal 
relevant information while minimizing redundant data and en-
ergy requirements for underlying biosensors. To address this 
issue, an ongoing multicenter EMU study has been launched 
(Swiss  National  Fund  “Severity”  study  #320030_179240) 
that will capture EEG, arm EMG, arm and body movements, 
cardiorespiratory  functions,  and  electrodermal  activity  dur-
ing  GTCS  in  75  patients.  The  collected  data  shall  help  us 
design future wearable devices that will not only detect but 
also best characterize GTCS severity.

The  intuitive  notion  that  GTCS  severity  predicts  SUDEP 
has  not  yet  been  convincingly  demonstrated.  Clinically 
validated wearable devices that reliably detect GTCS may 
lower SUDEP risk, because a higher incidence of SUDEP 
was  documented  in  patients  with  a  lower  grade  of  super-
vision.57  Ways  forward  shall  include  large  retrospective 
case-control  studies  of  SUDEP  patients  who  previously 
underwent  a  video-EEG  to  determine  whether  currently 
available biomarkers of GTCS severity are significant pre-
dictors. In parallel, data from wearables optimally designed 
to capture GTCS severity in ambulatory subjects should be 
correlated to other SUDEP surrogate markers, such as the 
SUDEP-7 inventory.38 Eventually, large prospective stud-
ies will be needed to demonstrate the potential of wearable 
devices to provide clinically relevant prediction of SUDEP.

technologies to characterize seizure severity and to identify 
seizures with high risk of morbidity and mortality. Several 
modalities  recorded  by  wearable  devices  can  provide  bio-
markers  of  seizure  severity,  inferred  from  the  type,  fre-
quency, and duration of the seizures, postictal position and 
immobility,  autonomic  changes  derived  from  ECG/HRV, 
EDA, respiration, and oxygen saturation. Multimodal wear-
able devices monitoring these biosignals can potentially pro-
vide valuable data for individual risk assessment, as well as a 
better understanding of the pathophysiology and prevention 
of SUDEP.
