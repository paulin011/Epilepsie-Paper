ECG changes in epilepsy patients. 
Acta  Neurol Scand 1997: 96: 72-75.  0 Munksgaard  1997. 

Objectives - To investigate the frequency of  ECG abnormalities suggestive 
of myocardial ischaemia in patients with severe drug resistant epilepsy and 
without any indication of  previous  cardiac disease, assuming that these 
changes may be of significance for the group of epileptic patients with sudden 
unexpected death. Material and  methods  - Twelve patients with medically 
intractable epilepsy were investigated with simultaneous long ECG and 
EEG recordings while attending either epilepsy surgery investigational 
procedures or the investigational programme for diagnostic purposes, and 
one while having an episode of  status epilepticus. Results - The ECG 
recording failed in  1 patient. This patient  had  chest pain  and minor yet 
morphologically conspicuous changes in the ECG, suggestive of  myocardial 
infarction. He died in heart  arrest. Eight epilepsy patients had episodes of 
ST segment depression  in the ECG, many of  which coincided with  video- 
and EEG documented epileptic seizures. Two patients experiencing simple 
partial  seizures and 1 patient  experiencing absence seizures had  no ST 
segment depressions in the ECG. One patient  had  an episode of  status 
epilepticus secondary to brain damage and no ST segment deviation was seen 
during the ECG recording which continued until 3 h before the patient died. 
Conclusion - Patients with severe drug resistant epilepsy have episodes of 
ST segment changes, some of  which are closely related to epileptic seizures. 
Further studies are needed to confirm the present results and to investigate 
the nature  of  these changes and document the effect of  prophylactic 
treatment  with  cardioactive drugs to reduce the risk  of  sudden death.

Epilepsy  is  one  of  the  commonest  neurological 
disorders. About  5%  of  the population will suffer 
an epileptic episode during their life-time, and  1 % 
have  epilepsy  (1). In  Denmark  there  are  about 
4S,OOO  persons who need a continuous treatment of 
their epileptic seizures (2). It has been estimated that 
people  with  epilepsy have  an  increased  mortality 
risk  - approximately 2-3x  that  of  the population 
at large (3,4), with the majority of deaths occurring 
in  people  aged between  10 and 40 years  (5). 

A still unexplained phenomenon among epilepsy 
patients is sudden death (SUDEP), which accounts 
for up to 15% mortality in this patient group  (6). 
In  some  cases  instantaneous  death  has  been 
observed  in  connection  with  generalized  epileptic 
seizures, but  in most  instances  the terminal  event 
is  unwitnessed  and  the  pathogenesis  unknown. 
Ambulatory long-term ECG registration  over 24 h 
have been  made  (7) showing cardiac arrhythmias.

To  our  knowledge, no  prior  reports  of  long-term 
EEG monitoring  over  several days with  simulta- 
neous long-term  ECG registration  in  hospitalized 
patients with refractory epilepsy have been published. 
In the present paper the case reports and results 
of  long-term  ECG in  13 patients with  severe drug 
resistant  epilepsy are presented. 

The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  establish  the 
number  of  epilepsy  patients  required  in  a  future 
study  aiming at investigating the  effect of  a  com- 
bined treatment with a betablocking and a calcium 
channel blocking agent on the potentially  danger- 
ous  noxae  exerted  by  the  epileptic  activity  on 
myocardial tissue as reflected  in the ECG. 

Material and methods 

All  patients  gave  their  informed  consent  before 
entering the study. 

Thirteen patients (6 females, 7 males), mean age: 
40  years  (range  17-76  years),  were  investigated. 
Twelve  of  the  patients  were  diagnosed  as  having 

severe, drug resistant  epilepsy. Eleven  had  partial 
epilepsy with and without secondary generalization 
and  2  with  primary  generalized  epilepsy.  Nine 
underwent  epilepsy  surgery  investigational  pro- 
cedures, 3 patients were investigated for diagnostic 
purposes  and  1 patient  had  a  long-term  ECG 
recording during a status epilepticus episode. 

The  epilepsy  surgery  programme  represents  a 
unique  test  situation  as  patients  are experiencing 
many  seizures  within  a  short  time  due  to  with- 
drawal of  standard  epilepsy medication  according 
to the special investigational procedure. 

One patient (case no. 8) had a history of  paroxys- 
mal atrial fibrillation, the other 12 patients had no 
history of  cardiac disease or had ever taken cardio- 
active drugs. 

The  patients  had  never  received  any  kind  of 
cardiac  medication.  Long-term  ECG  monitoring 
(Holter monitor)  was  performed  during 4-5  days 
in  12 patients.  Standard  ECG  recordings  at  rest 
were performed prior  to study entry. 

All  patients  had  a  long-term  video  electro- 
encephalographic  (EEG) registration  with  special 
equipment according to standard technique. Holter 
and long EEG registrations  were simultaneous  in 
12 patients. 

Videoregistrations  as  well  as  the  patients’  own 
observations were recorded. After finishing the moni- 
toring procedures  the  antiepileptic  treatment  was 
re-established. 

Results 

The  long-term  ECG recording  failed  in  1 patient 
with  partial  epilepsy  (case  no.  1). During  4 days 
with  video-EEG  monitoring  he  experienced  8 
complex partial  seizures and  4 secondarily gener- 
alized  seizures. At  the  end  of  the monitoring  the 
antiepileptic  treatment  was  fully  re-established. 
During  the  following  6days  the  patient  experi- 
enced  2  more  complex partial  seizures. Two days 
after  the  last  seizure  the  patient  complained  of 
chest  discomfort.  The  standard  ECG  showed 
reduction of  QRS amplitude and small negative T- 
waves of  “coronary” appearance. The patient died 
in  cardiac arrest  irresponsive to resuscitation  pro- 
cedures 3 days after the last seizure. 

ECG  abnormalities  suggestive  of  myocardial 
ischaemia, such as ST segment depression below 1 
mm, each lasting more  than  1 min, were  found  in 
8  patients. The  majority  of  ST depressions  found 
in  the  ECG  coincided  with  video-  and  EEG- 
documented epileptic seizures. The most severe ST 
depression was 4.4 mm. 

In 2 patients experiencing simple partial seizures 
and  1 experiencing  absence  seizures  during  the 
recordings, no ST segment depressions were found. 

ECG changes in epilepsy patients 

One  patient  (case  no.  8),  operated  on  for  a 
prostatic  cancer  in  1992,  was  admitted  to  the 
urologic department for increasing fatigue. Before 
admission  to  the  hospital  the  patient  fell  and 
possibly injured his head. During hospitalization he 
developed  a  severe,  drug  refractory  episode  of 
status epilepticus and  he  was  urgently  transferred 
to  the  neurological  department.  The  ECG moni- 
toring  was  started  immediately  after  the  transfer 
and performed  over the  following 24 h. The ECG 
monitoring  was  terminated  3 h before  the patient 
died  of  respiratory  failure.  Autopsy  revealed  a 
small subdural haemorrhage  with a  slight impres- 
sion  on  the  surface of  the  left  frontal  lobe  of  the 
brain. These findings are detailed in Table 1. 

Discussion 

Epilepsy,  however  disabling it  may  be,  is  usually 
not  considered  to  be  a  fatal  condition.  It  is  well 
known  that  epilepsy may be secondary to another 
disease, which implies an  increased  risk  of  death, 
e.g. brain tumour, but both patients and physicians 
seem  to  ignore  the  fact  that  epilepsy per  se  may 
constitute a risk  factor  concerning life expectancy 
(8). 

Even  though  epilepsy  is  a  chronic  condition 
many  deaths  which  are  ascribed  to  the  disorder 
occur suddenly and unexpectedly. Moreover, clini- 
cians and pathologists are puzzled by the frequency 
by  which  deaths  of  patients  with  epilepsy remain 
unexplained  despite  post-mortem  examinations 
(8). 

Several reports have been made reporting cardiac 
tachycardia  as  the  most  common  phenomenon 
related  to partial  epilepsy, with  or without  secon- 
dary  generalization,  but  bradyarrhythmias  also 
occur (9). Asystolia has been reported as an unusual 
event  (10).  ST  elevation  has  only  been  reported 
once  as a  case report  (11). It  has  been  published 
only as a single report  regarding  autopsy material 
of  myocardium  in  patients  with  epilepsy  demon- 
strating interstitial fibrosis connected with atrophy 
or  myofibrillar  degeneration  (12),  which  can  be 
caused by  heart ischaemia. 

The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  how 
many patients  with  severe  drug resistant  epilepsy 
will  have  ECG  changes  during  a  5 day  period  of 
hospital observation, in which the patients undergo 
either an investigational procedure  (10 cases) or a 
continuous  observation  due  to  refractory  status 
epilepticus, in order to establish how many subjects 
should be  enrolled  in  a  future  placebo-controlled 
study aiming at treating these patients with a drug 
with anti-ischaemic or anti-arrhythmic properties 
or  both  and  to  detect  a  difference  of  statistical 
significance.

The results of  the present pilot study showed that 
episodes of  ST depression  appeared  in  8  patients 
with  severe  partial  epilepsy  disease,  whereas  no 
changes  were  detected  in  1  patient  with  drug 
refractory  status epilepticus evolved  secondary  to 
brain  damage. Neither  the 2  patients  who  experi- 
enced  only  simple  partial  seizures  during  the 
recordings,  nor  the  patient  experiencing  absence 
seizures and one primary generalized seizure during 
long EEG registration  had  ECG changes. In sev- 
eral cases there was registered a temporal relation- 
ship between  secondarily generalized  seizures and 
ST segment depression. Regular extracardiac activity 
signals,  undoubtedly  produced  by  rapid  muscle 
contraction  during  the  tonic-clonic  convulsions, 
were recorded  in the ECG in all the cases having 
secondarily  generalized  seizures. The  convulsions 

were  preceded  by  ST depression  probably  due to 
generalized  tonic phase, and continued  for several 
min  after seizures’ cessation. 

It  has  to  be  stressed, that  extracardiac  activity 
signal indicating convulsions was  seen in  ECG of 
4 patients with convulsive seizures at a time when 
no  epileptic  activity  was  discovered  by  EEG  or 
video tape recordings. 

The  pathophysiologic processes involved in  the 
lethal events are incompletely known. It is known 
that in seizures cardiac arrhythmia developed prob- 
ably as a  result  of  sympathetic hyperactivity (13). 
As  death  is  usually  sudden,  malignant  cardiac 
arrhythmias are suspected to be the most frequent 
cause. However,  as  death  often  occurs  unexpect- 
edly and without close temporal relation to known 
epileptic  seizures, the  fatal  arrhythmia  is  thought

tissue produced by excessive catecholamine stimu- 
lation, ischaemia or both. 

The findings of  this study showed that almost all 
patients  experiencing  frequent  secondarily  gener- 
alized seizures and without indications of  previous 
ischaemic heart disease have episodes of  ST depres- 
sion in the ECG in periods with epileptic activity. 
In  conclusion  this  study  showed  that  patients 
with  severe  drug  resistant  partial  epilepsy  have 
episodes of  ST segment changes, some of  which are 
closely  related  to  the  epileptic  seizure.  Further 
studies are needed  to  confirm the present  results 
and to document the effect of  prophylactic medical 
treatment.
