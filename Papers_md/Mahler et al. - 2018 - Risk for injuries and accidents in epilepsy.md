Abstract

Objective
To study the risk for injuries/accidents in people with newly diagnosed epileptic seizures in
relation to comorbidities.

Methods
Between September 1, 2001, and August 31, 2008, individuals in northern Stockholm with
incident unprovoked seizures (epilepsy; n = 2,130) were included in a registry. For every
epilepsy patient, 8 individuals matched for sex and inclusion year (n = 16,992) were randomly
selected as references from the population of the catchment area. Occurrence of injuries/
accidents was monitored through the national patient and cause of death registers until De-
cember 31, 2013. These registers also provided information on comorbidities (e.g., brain tumor,
stroke, psychiatric disease, diabetes mellitus).

Results
Injury/accident was demonstrated in 1,033 epilepsy cases and 6,202 references (hazard ratio
[HR] 1.71, 95% conﬁdence interval 1.60–1.83). The excess risk was seen mainly during the ﬁrst
2 years after diagnosis. Sex and educational status had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on HR. The risk was
normal in children but increased in adults. Highest HR was seen for drowning, poisoning,
adverse eﬀect of medication, and severe traumatic brain injury. Compared to references without
comorbidities, HR was 1.17 (1.07–1.28) in epilepsy without comorbidities, 4.52 (4.18–4.88) in
references with comorbidities, and 7.15 (6.49–7.87) in epilepsy with comorbidities.

Conclusion
Presence of comorbidities should be considered when counseling patients with newly di-
agnosed epilepsy concerning risk for injuries/accidents. Early information is important, as the
risk is highest during the ﬁrst 2 years following seizure onset.

CI = conﬁdence interval; HR = hazard ratio; ICD-10 = International Classiﬁcation of Diseases–10; RERI = relative excess risk due
to interaction; SIRE = Stockholm Incidence Registry of Epilepsy; TBI = traumatic brain injury.

Compared to the general population, people with epilepsy have an
increased risk for accidental injury.1,2 Current data are, however,
conﬂicting regarding the level of this increase, as hospital-based
studies3,4 and studies performed on institutionalized patients5 tend
to show high risks, in contrast to population-based studies, which
show minor6–8 or no risk increase.9 Prospective studies are ham-
pered by short follow-up periods,10 inclusion of few11 or prevalent9
cases, and lack of a suitable reference population.12,13

Further examination of types and mechanisms of injuries and
accidents as well as of possible risk factors such as sex, age,
seizure type, or time since epilepsy onset is important in order
to better understand risks associated with epileptic seizures
and to facilitate actions that reduce these risks.

The increased risk for injury observed in people with epilepsy
may be caused not only by seizures, but also by comorbid
conditions aﬀecting cognition, vigilance, or balance, which are
frequent in people with epilepsy,2,14 or might be an eﬀect of
interaction between seizures and comorbidities, which also
remains to be investigated.

Our aim was to investigate the risk for traumatic injury or
accident in persons with epilepsy in relation to a wide range of
comorbidities, to explore the nature of the injury, role of
seizure type, time from onset, age at onset, and sex. Analyses
were based on data from a large population-based study in-
cluding 2,130 patients newly diagnosed with incident un-
provoked seizures and a reference population of 16,992
matched, population-based individuals without seizures.

Methods

Study population
Individuals with epilepsy were identiﬁed through the Stockholm
Incidence Registry of Epilepsy (SIRE), a population-based in-
cidence register covering cases occurring in the northern parts of
Stockholm, an urban region with 998,500 inhabitants, between
2000 and 2008. The SIRE methodology has been described in
detail before.15 In short, from September 1, 2000, all patients
older than 15 years, and from September 1, 2001, patients of all
ages (>1 month) identiﬁed with a ﬁrst unprovoked seizure or
incident epilepsy were included in SIRE. Inclusion ﬁnished on
August 31, 2008. Potential patients living in the catchment area
were identiﬁed through reports from neurologists, pediatricians,
and geriatricians or nurses in nursing homes in the region. We
also screened all medical records of patients referred to the
neuro-oncology section of the Karolinska University Hospital
and from patients discharged for the ﬁrst time from the De-
partment of Neurology or Pediatrics at the same hospital with

the ICD-10 diagnoses G40, G41, or R56.8. Pediatric emergency
room records were evaluated, and all EEG requests to the local
EEG laboratory were screened for patients with suspected seiz-
ures. Medical records of all potential cases were evaluated by an
expert panel and cases were classiﬁed based on the available
information 6 months after the index seizure according to
standards for epidemiologic studies and surveillance of epilepsy
by the International League Against Epilepsy.16 All those with
unprovoked seizures conﬁrmed by the medical chart review were
included in SIRE and the analysis of this article (n = 2,130,
hereafter referred to as epilepsy cases).

For each epilepsy case, 8 persons, matched by sex, catchment area,
and year of diagnosis, were randomly selected from the Pop-
ulation Register of Stockholm County (n = 16 992, hereafter
referred to as reference population). Members of the reference
population with an incident seizure after the date of matching
were included in SIRE as epilepsy case from the date of the
seizure.

Register linkage
The study population was linked to the Swedish national regis-
ters for inpatient and outpatient care and cause of death using the
10-digit personal identiﬁcation number assigned to all Swedish
citizens. The cause of death register is available since 1952, the
national inpatient register since 1987, and the outpatient register
since 2001 (except for hospital-associated surgery, where data are
available since 1997). Loss to follow-up is considered minimal
and limited to migration, while diagnoses have been shown to be
of high accuracy,17 and are coded by the Swedish version of the
ICD-10 since January 1, 1997. Registration in these health reg-
isters is compulsory by law and considered complete nationwide.
This provided information on comorbidity and also allowed us to
follow-up injuries and accidents.

The Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance
and Labour Market Studies rendered information on educa-
tional status. Such data were accessible for 90% of the study
population, missing primarily in children. Educational status
was deﬁned as primary education (1 to 9 years of compulsory
education), secondary education (10 to 12 years of educa-
tion), and tertiary (university) education.

(F90–F98),28 and congenital malformations, deformations, and
chromosomal abnormalities (Q00–Q99),29 was collected from
the registers from January 1, 1997, until date of injury.

Follow-up of injuries and accidents
Patients were followed in the registers from baseline (which was
date of inclusion in SIRE/index date for matched references)
until the ﬁrst of the following events occurred: diagnosis of injury
or accident in any of the registers, death, or December 31, 2013.
Diagnoses were deﬁned as ICD-10 codes for “injury, poisoning
and certain other consequences of external causes” (S00-T98) or
“external causes of morbidity and mortality” (V00-Y98) in the
registers. Injuries were further subdivided according to their lo-
calization or the mechanism causing injury. The examined ICD-
10 codes are listed in table e-1 (links.lww.com/WNL/A198).

Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.3, SAS In-
stitute Inc., Cary, NC).

We used Cox proportional hazard regression to calculate hazard
ratios (HR) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (95% CIs) for acci-
dents and injuries in relation to epilepsy. HRs were adjusted for
age group (0–14 years, 15–29 years, 30–64 years, or 65 years and
older at inclusion), sex, and comorbidity (yes/no). Analyses were
stratiﬁed by age group, sex, and educational status. Inﬂuences of
possible eﬀect modiﬁers, such as seizure classiﬁcation, etiology,
and earlier injury on HR, were examined separately. External
causes of accidents and injuries were examined separately. HR of
accidents/injuries were calculated in relation to the combination
of epilepsy and diﬀerent comorbidities and additive interaction
between epilepsy/comorbidity was calculated by relative excess
risk due to interaction (RERI).30 Sensitivity analysis was per-
formed after exclusion of all individuals with accidents/injuries
before baseline. The time course for occurrence of ﬁrst accident
or injury was calculated among epilepsy cases and compared to
the reference population by means of a Kaplan-Meier analysis.
Information on occurrence of accidents or injuries was evaluated
for each register separately as well as for all registers together.

Standard protocol approvals, registration, and
patient consents
Approval was granted by the Ethics Review Board at Kar-
olinska Institutet, Stockholm, which deemed that no in-
dividual informed consent was required.

Results

Risk for injuries in epilepsy by sex, type of
seizure, and age
Epilepsy was associated with an increased risk of injury and
accident (HR 1.71), which was attenuated after adjustment
for comorbidity (HR 1.30). The excess risk due to epilepsy
did not diﬀer by seizure type and was similar in men and
women, although women in general had a slightly lower risk
than men (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87–0.96).

No increased risk was seen in individuals exposed to epilepsy
prior to age 15 compared to reference population of the same
age, while all other age categories showed a risk increase
among epilepsy cases (table 2).

Stratiﬁcation by education showed a similar increase in HR
and 95% CI for all examined groups, ranging from 1.82
(1.53–2.16) for cases with primary education to 1.62
(1.44–1.81) for cases with tertiary education.

Restricting the analysis to individuals without trauma or injury
before inclusion yielded similar results.

The HR for accident or injury was 3.99 (95% CI 2.86–5.42)
in the cause of death registry, 2.09 (95% CI 1.88–2.32) in
the hospital discharge registry,
and 1.31 (95% CI
1.22–1.41) in the outpatient registry.

mosomal abnormalities.
b Epilepsy cases and reference population without trauma or accident from introduction of the Swedish version of ICD-10 in January 1, 1997, until inclusion in
the study.

Locations and types of injuries
Injuries were most frequently localized to the upper ex-
tremity, followed by the lower extremity and the head
(table 3). The most frequent types were fractures, super-
ﬁcial injuries, and open wounds. The highest HR was seen
for drowning and nonlethal submersion accidents, followed
by poisoning by medication, unspeciﬁed adverse eﬀect of
drug or medication, and severe traumatic brain in-
jury (TBI).

When adjusting for comorbidity, epilepsy cases had an in-
creased risk only for injuries to head, neck, and torso. The
risk for fractures was still increased, as well as the risk for
complications of surgical and medical care (not elsewhere
classiﬁed) and other and unspeciﬁed eﬀects of external
causes. There was still an increased risk for drowning,
poisoning by drugs, adverse eﬀect of medicaments, severe
TBI, infections following a procedure, luxation of shoulder,
and mild TBI.

The most frequent external causes of accidents were falls,
exposure to unspeciﬁed factors, and medical and surgical
complications, while the highest HR was observed for medical
or surgical complications, followed by self-harm of intentional
or of undetermined intent and falls.

When adjusting for comorbidity, the only causes remaining
with increased risk among epilepsy cases were falls and
complications of medical and surgical care.

Risk for injury or accident in relation to the
combination of epilepsy and comorbidities
The eﬀect of comorbidities on the risk of injuries or accidents
is presented in table 4. The HR for trauma in epilepsy without
any of the analyzed comorbidities was estimated at 1.17,
whereas the HR in individuals with any of the comorbidities
among the reference population was 4.79.

The risk for trauma was elevated more than 7-fold in
individuals with a combination of epilepsy and comorbidity
and interaction was conﬁrmed with a RERI of 2.27. Out of
the diﬀerent comorbidities investigated, signiﬁcant
in-
teraction with epilepsy was seen for malignant brain tumor,
stroke, diabetes mellitus, and psychiatric disease, and this
interaction was most pronounced for malignant brain
tumor.

Time course of injury risk
The risk for injuries was highest among epilepsy cases
during the ﬁrst 2 years after inclusion. Within this time
span, 23% of epilepsy cases and 11% of the reference

population without any comorbidity had an injury or ac-
cident. Thereafter, the excess risk among epilepsy cases
gradually declined and eventually approached the risk in
the reference population (ﬁgure). Epilepsy greatly in-
creased the risk for having an accident or injury among
persons with comorbidity and markedly shortened the time
until this occurred. While it took 4.12 years until 50% of the
reference population with comorbidity had an accident or

injury, half of epilepsy cases with comorbidity had an ac-
cident or injury within 1.89 years.

Discussion

In this population-based study, we conﬁrmed that epilepsy
was associated with an increased risk of injuries and acci-
dents; that sex and education had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence;

to follow-up and with a matched reference population. The
use of multiple health care registries permits us to evaluate the
risk for various types of injuries and assess the inﬂuence of
comorbidities with high accuracy, while recall bias is avoided.

Among limitations, the seizure diagnosis was based on review
of data available in medical records 6 months after the index
seizure, which in some cases is too short for a detailed clas-
siﬁcation. In addition, we do not have access to information
on seizure control after the ﬁrst 6 months since the index
seizure. Being based on ICD codes and register data, we did
not have information on if accidents or injuries were seizure-
related. Our study setup did not allow reliable estimates on
occurrence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Milder
injuries will not be identiﬁed, but are less of a burden for the
patient. Our results regarding outcome also rely on the val-
idity of the diagnoses in the registries. Traumatic injuries and
accidents are expected to be diagnosed with high accuracy in
the utilized registers.17,31 In the current analysis, we examined
the risk of having a ﬁrst event of trauma/injury. No in-
formation on further traumatic accidents of the same kind was
considered, as this risk is expected to increase after a ﬁrst
injury.

Several earlier studies have demonstrated that people with
epilepsy are at higher risk for traumatic injuries than healthy
controls. As in other population-based studies,4,9 we found
a less than doubled risk increase in our epilepsy cases com-
pared to the reference population, and the increased risk for
fractures3,7 and for head injuries32,33 is in line with earlier
studies. Vestergaard34 in a meta-analysis reported a HR of 2.2
(95% CI 1.9–2.5) for fractures in persons with epilepsy, which
is in line with our results (HR 1.80; 95% CI 1.62–1.99).

While
for
comorbidities,6,35 we are not aware of any other study ana-
lyzing interactions between epilepsy and diﬀerent diseases
known to increase the risk for accidents due to cognitive
impairment or by aﬀection of vigilance or balance. As such
diseases are common among people with epilepsy, this ap-
proach is important, as the interaction of diagnoses could
result in an overestimation of the risk attributed to epilepsy. In
our study, the inﬂuence of epilepsy alone on the risk for
persons having injuries or accidents is modest in comparison
to the eﬀect of the examined comorbidities, while persons
with a combination of epilepsy and comorbidity appear to
have a supra-additive eﬀect on the risk of accidents and
injuries. This eﬀect seems to be especially high in patients with
malignant brain tumor and epilepsy.

The risk of having an injury or accident was not elevated
among epilepsy cases younger than 15 years at inclusion
(when adjusting for comorbidity28). A possible explanation is
supervision of children with epilepsy by family and other
caregivers.

The increased risk during the ﬁrst 2 years after diagnosis was
gradually normalized later in the observation period. This is in
line with previous studies on fractures and epilepsy3,36 and is
probably a consequence of a combination of remission of the
epilepsy, eﬀective patient counseling, and that some persons
with comorbidities die.

Compared to others, people with epilepsy are admitted to the
hospital more often after an accident or injury. This may be
a consequence of the severity of the injury, a comorbidity,
seizure-related hospitalization, or a more cautious attitude

our study, the HR was higher for severe TBI than for mild
TBI. We also found a higher HR in the cause of death registry
and the hospital discharge registry compared with the out-
patient registry, suggesting that more severe injuries occurred
in epilepsy cases compared to the reference population.

As expected, the risk for traﬃc accidents,37 burns and scalds,38
as well as drowning39 were increased among epilepsy cases.
While traﬃc accidents were more frequent among epilepsy
cases, the risk for car accidents was not increased, in contrast
to a doubled risk for bicycle accidents. All bicycle accidents
aﬀect the driver of the vehicle, while car accidents may also
include passengers. HR therefore is expected to be lower for
car than for bicycle accidents among epilepsy cases. Motor
vehicle driving for persons with active epilepsy is also re-
stricted by law, and our data indicate that current restrictions
are eﬀective. When adjusting for comorbidity, the risk was
normalized for both burns and scalds as well as for traﬃc
accidents.

Drowning in epilepsy has been assessed in a meta-analy-
sis,40 reporting a standardized mortality ratio of 18.7 (95%
CI 15–23.1) for persons with epilepsy from 51 cohorts with
88 drowning deaths among people with epilepsy. Our es-
timated HR of 11.39 (95% CI 2.28–56.98) for drowning
and nonfatal submersion is comparable to these results.
Two of 3 epilepsy cases with fatal drowning were consid-
ered intentional self-harm and 1 case was due to alcohol
intoxication. One fatal drowning in the reference pop-
ulation was classiﬁed as being of undetermined intent,
while the other 2 references had nonfatal accidental
drowning. The low number of incidents of fatal drowning
accidents among controls in our study (1/126,983 person-
years) is in line with the average number of drowning
deaths in Sweden in general (1.13/100,000 person-years
according to oﬃcial statistics from Svenska Livr¨add-
ningss¨allskapet), which is
low compared to the in-
ternational ﬁgure (7.4/100,000 person-years40).

Being population-based, our results are generalizable for
people with newly diagnosed epilepsy regarding injuries or
accidents requiring hospital-associated health care, as long as
it is applied to persons living in urban societies of the western
world with similar access to hospital and outpatient care as
Sweden. As all hospital-associated patient contacts and deaths
are registered in these registers, catchment of injury diagnoses
severe enough to need the health care resources of hospitals
or hospital-associated outpatient clinics should be complete
for all patients within the borders of Sweden and the number
lost to follow-up is minimal.

Our data highlight the importance of considering comorbid-
ities in counseling patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy for
risk for injuries and accidents. Early information is important,
as the risk for initial injury is highest during the ﬁrst 2 years
following seizure onset.

Study question
Does the presence of comorbidities inﬂuence the risk of
accidents and injuries among individuals with epilepsy?

Summary answer
Epilepsy was associated with an increased risk of injuries and
accidents—particularly drowning, poisoning, adverse eﬀects
of medication, and severe traumatic brain injury—in adults
only, which was higher
for patients with various
comorbidities.

What is known and what this paper adds
Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with epi-
lepsy are at higher risk for traumatic injuries than healthy
controls. This study demonstrates that the risk for accidents/
injuries is higher in patients with epilepsy and comorbid
conditions (e.g., brain tumor, stroke, and psychiatric disease)
than in those with epilepsy alone.

Participants and setting
This population-based cohort study included 2,130 patients
with epilepsy from northern Stockholm who had experienced
unprovoked, incident seizures between 2001 and 2008, and
16,992 controls matched for sex and year of inclusion.

Design
Individuals with epilepsy were identiﬁed through the Stock-
holm Incidence Registry of Epilepsy (SIRE). Information on
selected conditions associated with epilepsy and the pro-
pensity for injuries and accidents was collected, and patients
were followed until the diagnosis of injury or accident, death,
or until December 31, 2013. Cox proportional hazard models
were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CI) for accidents and injuries in relation to epilepsy.

in individuals diagnosed with epilepsy prior to age 15. The
highest HRs were observed for drowning and non-lethal
submersion accidents,
followed by medication poisoning,
unspeciﬁed adverse eﬀects of medication, and severe trau-
matic brain injury. The risk for trauma was elevated more than
seven-fold in individuals with a combination of epilepsy and
comorbidity. The risk for injury among patients with epilepsy
was highest during the ﬁrst 2 years after inclusion.

Bias, confounding factors, and other reasons
for caution
Seizure diagnosis was based on data available 6 months after
the index seizure, which may have inhibited detailed
classiﬁcation.

Generalizability to other populations
The study ﬁndings may be generalizable to patients with
newly diagnosed epilepsy living in urban areas of the Western
world.

Main results and the role of chance
Epilepsy was associated with an increased risk of injury and
accident (HR = 1.71), which was attenuated after adjustment
for comorbidity (HR = 1.30). No increased risk was observed
