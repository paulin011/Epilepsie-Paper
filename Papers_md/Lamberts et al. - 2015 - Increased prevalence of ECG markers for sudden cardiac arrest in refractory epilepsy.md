ABSTRACT
Background and aim People with epilepsy are
at increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to
ECG-conﬁrmed ventricular tachycardia/ﬁbrillation, as
seen in a community-based study. We aimed to
determine whether ECG-risk markers of SCA are more
prevalent in people with epilepsy.
Methods In a cross-sectional, retrospective study,
we analysed the ECG recordings of 185 people with
refractory epilepsy and 178 controls without epilepsy.
Data on epilepsy characteristics, cardiac comorbidity,
and drug use were collected, and general ECG variables
(heart rate (HR), PQ and QRS intervals) assessed. We
analysed ECGs for three markers of SCA risk: severe QTc
prolongation (male >450 ms, female >470 ms), Brugada
ECG pattern, and early repolarisation pattern (ERP).
Multivariate regression models were used to analyse
differences between groups, and to identify associated
clinical and epilepsy-related characteristics.
Results People with epilepsy had higher HR (71 vs
62 bpm, p<0.001) and a longer PQ interval (162.8 vs
152.6 ms, p=0.001). Severe QTc prolongation and ERP
were more prevalent in people with epilepsy (QTc
prolongation: 5% vs 0%; p=0.002; ERP: 34% vs 13%,
p<0.001), while the Brugada ECG pattern was equally
frequent in both groups (2% vs 1%, p>0.999). After
adjustment for covariates, epilepsy remained associated
with ERP (ORadj 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.5) and severe QTc
prolongation (ORadj 9.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 1317.7).
Conclusions ERP and severe QTc prolongation appear
to be more prevalent in people with refractory epilepsy.
Future studies must determine whether this contributes
to increased SCA risk in people with epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION
A recent community-based study found that people
with epilepsy had a twofold to threefold increased
risk of ECG-conﬁrmed sudden cardiac arrest
(SCA), that is, ventricular tachycardia/ﬁbrillation,
irrespective of the traditional cardiac risk factors
for SCA.1 A 12-lead standard ECG is a potential
low-cost screening test for SCA risk. Several ECG
markers for SCA risk have been established in the
general population; these include severe QTc pro-
longation,2–4 Brugada ECG pattern (Brugada
ECG),5 and early repolarisation pattern (ERP).6–9

QTc prolongation reﬂects abnormal cardiac repo-
larisation. In most studies comparing people with
epilepsy and without epilepsy, mild QTc prolonga-
tion was reported in those with epilepsy,10–12 while
in both
others reported similar QTc durations
groups,13 14 or QTc shortening.15 16 The number

of people with severe QTc prolongation was not
reported in these studies.

Brugada ECG is characteristic of Brugada syn-
drome, an inherited disease associated with dis-
rupted cardiac depolarisation.17 Sudden death in
young people with structurally normal hearts in
epilepsy and Brugada syndrome occurs mainly
during rest or sleep.17–19 ERP, long considered a
benign and more common variant of the Brugada
ECG, was found to be more prevalent in people
with idiopathic ventricular ﬁbrillation than in
healthy controls.20 21 Subsequently, ERP was iden-
tiﬁed as an independent predictor of SCA in several
population-based studies.6–9

We hypothesise that the prevalence of severe
QTc prolongation, Brugada ECG, and ERP, are
increased in people with epilepsy; this may ( partly)
explain the higher SCA risk in epilepsy.

METHODS
Cases
Cases consisted of 188 consecutive people with
conﬁrmed drug-refractory epilepsy,22 who were
assessed at one epilepsy tertiary referral centre
between September 2009 and April 2011. In all, a
resting 12-lead ECG was recorded as part of the
routine assessment on initial evaluation.23 The
anonymised data were obtained as part of an audit
into epilepsy-associated comorbidities, which was
approved as such by the local ethics committee. As
all data was acquired during routine clinical care,
no informed consent was required.

Controls
Controls were drawn from a substudy of The
Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety.24
They were 18–65 years old, randomly selected
from a general practitioners’ database in the
Amsterdam area, and had no lifetime history of a
psychiatric disorder.24 A resting 12-lead ECG was
recorded in 179 subjects. We excluded all those
with a diagnosis of active epilepsy or current use of
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (n=1), leaving 178 con-
trols. The study was approved by the local ethics
committee. Informed consent was obtained from
all participants.

ECG analysis
In all participants, conventional characteristics of
the 12-lead ECG (heart rate (HR), PQ, and QRS
duration) were automatically determined. Brugada
ECG was classiﬁed as type-1 (coved ST-segment
elevation in right precordial ECG leads ≥0.2 mV

followed by a negative T-wave with little or no isoelectric separ-
ation), type 2 (coved ST-segment elevation in V1–V3 followed
by a gradually descending ST-segment elevation remaining
≥0.1 mV above the baseline and a positive or biphasic T-wave
that results in a saddleback conﬁguration), or type 3 (right pre-
cordial ST-segment elevation of ≥0.1 mV of saddleback type,
coved type, or both), according to Brugada syndrome consensus
criteria.25 QTc duration was calculated using Bazett’s formula
to correct for HR: QT/√RR.26 Severe QTc prolongation was
deﬁned according to the European Society of Cardiology
Guidelines: >450 ms in men, >470 ms in women.27 ERP was
deﬁned as J-point elevation ≥0.1 mV in ≥2 adjacent leads with
either slurring or notching morphology.7 20 Leads V1–V3 were
not assessed to avoid confusion with ECG patterns typical of
Brugada syndrome. ECGs with intraventricular conduction delay
(QRS duration of ≥0.12 s), which precluded reliable assessment
of QTc duration, Brugada ECG or ERP (n=3, all cases), were
excluded from analysis.7 20

An experienced cardiologist (HLT) reviewed all ECGs for
Brugada ECG pattern to ensure consistent classiﬁcation. The
QTc interval including the presence/absence of severe QTc pro-
longation and ERP were assessed by two blinded researchers
(RJL and MB). In case of disagreement between the examiners,
HLT provided the ﬁnal verdict. There was no systematic differ-
ence between the reviewers in their analysis of the QTc interval
( paired t test: 0.59) or ERP (κ score 0.75).

Assessment of comorbidities and medication use
Variables were collected from medical records (in cases) and on
self-reported/assessed information during a face-to-face interview (in
controls). These variables were: gender, age, presence of ≥2 cardiac
risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus),
presence of heart disease, and medication use. We deﬁned four
drug categories: (1) QT-prolonging medication (http://www.azcert.
org), (2) depolarisation-blocking drugs (http://www.brugadadrugs.
org), (3) cardiovascular drugs (β-adrenoreceptor blockers, calcium
channel antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
diuretics, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, nitrates, platelet aggrega-
tion inhibitors and/or statins) and (4) lipid-lowering drugs. Some
drugs ﬁt in more than one category.

Among AEDs, QT-prolonging drugs were phenytoin and fel-
bamate, while depolarisation-blocking drugs included carba-
mazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin and lamotrigine.

In people with epilepsy, additional data were recorded includ-
ing epilepsy aetiology (symptomatic/non-symptomatic), history
of epilepsy surgery (yes/no), age of onset and duration of epi-
lepsy, seizure frequency (≥1 vs <1/month), polytherapy (≥2
AEDs), presence of a learning disability, and family history of
epilepsy (≥2 family members with epilepsy).

Statistical analysis
Differences between cohorts in baseline characteristics and ECG
parameters were analysed using χ2 statistics for categorical vari-
test where appropriate) and
ables
Student t test/Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables.
We performed multivariate logistic regression models to deter-
mine whether epilepsy was
independently associated with
Brugada ECG, severe QTc prolongation, or ERP. We employed
two models: the ﬁrst included all determinants that were uni-
variately associated ( p<0.1) with outcome, whereas the second
model included only those determinants that also changed the
point estimate by ≥5%. As severe QTc prolongation was not
seen in controls, we used penalised logistic regression analysis to
perform multivariate analysis applying the same strategy as

above. Among people with epilepsy the same approach was used
to determine which clinical (comorbidities and medication use)
and epilepsy characteristics were associated with these SCA pre-
dictors. Statistics were performed in R ( penalised logistic regres-
sion analysis; R statistical package, V.2.14, package logistf,
V.1.10), and in SPSS (all other analyses; V.17.0 for Windows,
Chicago, Illinois, USA).

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
ECGs of 185 people with epilepsy and 178 controls were ana-
lysed (table 1). People with epilepsy were more often male (non-
signiﬁcant), were signiﬁcantly younger, and more frequently
used drugs with QT-prolonging or depolarisation-blocking
effects. QT-prolonging drugs used were AEDs (46%), antide-
pressants (30%), antipsychotics (20%), or antiemetics (5%),
whereas depolarisation-blocking drugs were almost exclusively
AEDs (99%). The prevalence of ≥2 cardiac risk factors, heart
disease, cardiovascular medication and lipid lowering drugs did
not differ between groups.

ECG analysis
People with epilepsy had a higher HR (71 vs 62 bpm,
p<0.001), a longer PQ interval, (163 vs 153 ms, p=0.001), and
shorter (though not statistically signiﬁcant) QRS interval (89 vs
91 ms, p=0.07). Mean QTc duration was also longer: 405 vs
394 ms, p<0.001. Brugada ECG was equally prevalent in both
groups (2% vs 1%, p>0.999). The prevalence of severe QTc
prolongation (5% vs 0%, p=0.002) and ERP (34% vs 13%,
p<0.001; ﬁgure 1) was higher in cases than in controls: table 1.

Multivariate analysis of severe QTc prolongation and ERP
Apart from epilepsy, severe QTc prolongation was univariately
associated with (female) gender, (lower) age, (higher) HR, and
use of depolarisation-blocking drugs (see online supplementary
table e-1). QT-prolonging drugs were not used by those with
severe QTc prolongation. Due to the absence of severe QTc pro-
longation in the control cohort, it was not possible to separate
the effects of epilepsy and use of depolarisation-blocking drugs
(99% of which were AEDs) in multivariate analysis. Therefore,
only epilepsy, gender, age, and HR were entered in the model
(penalised logistic regression, table 2). After correction for these
variables epilepsy remained associated with severe QTc pro-
longation (table 2, Model A: ORadj 9.9 (1.1 to 1317.7).

ERP was univariately associated with epilepsy, (male) gender,
heart disease, (higher) HR, and the use of QT-prolonging,
depolarisation-blocking, and cardiovascular drugs (see online
supplementary table e-2). Multivariate analysis showed epilepsy
to be independently associated with ERP: table 2, Model B:
ORadj 2.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 5.5).

In those with epilepsy (n=185) none of

the epilepsy
characteristics were associated with either severe QTc prolonga-
tion or ERP (see online supplementary tables e-3 and e-4).

DISCUSSION
We systematically analysed the prevalence of three ECG-risk
markers of SCA and found that severe QTc prolongation and
ERP were more frequent in people with refractory epilepsy.

Our study had some limitations. There were several differ-
ences between cases and controls: people with epilepsy were
younger and more likely to be male. Younger age may result in a
lower QTc interval and a higher ERP prevalence.28 29 In view of
the relatively small age differences in our study, however, only
minor effects on severe QTc prolongation and ERP should

be expected. Accordingly, having epilepsy remained signiﬁcantly
associated with severe QTc prolongation after correction for
age. ERP is more frequently found in males, but having epilepsy
remained an independent determinant after accounting for
gender differences.29 As for severe QTc prolongation, the associ-
ation with epilepsy also remained signiﬁcant after correction for
this variable in multivariate analysis, and using gender-speciﬁc
cut-off points. In accordance with previous studies, HR was
higher
this may be due to
epilepsy-related abnormalities of cardiac autonomic balance.30
HR is incorporated in the deﬁnition of severe QTc prolonga-
tion, but the use of Bazett’s formula may lead to an overesti-
mation of QTc duration in people with higher HR: particularly
those with epilepsy.26 We, therefore, included HR in the multi-
variate analysis of severe QTc prolongation and ERP. As severe
QTc prolongation as SCA marker has been deﬁned using
Bazett’s formula and for study comparability, we did not use
alternative QT correction formulae.

than in controls:

in cases

We found that QTc duration was increased in people with epi-
lepsy when compared with controls. This is concordant with
some,10–12 but not all previous studies.13–16 Conﬂicting ﬁndings
may be explained by differences in epilepsy severity or medica-
tion use between study populations. We analysed people with
refractory, more severe epilepsy than in previous studies. QTc

duration was dichotomised in one study (>440 ms, yes vs no),
allowing comparison between ours and their results.11 By con-
trast with our ﬁndings, they reported a similar prevalence of
QTc intervals >440 ms in cases and controls.11 Our more strin-
gent, gender-corrected deﬁnition of severe QTc prolongation
is recommended,
(>450 ms in men, >470 ms in women),
however, by the current guidelines of the European Society of
Cardiology and has been used in the more recent large-scale
prospective, population-based studies of SCA risk.3 27 We, there-
fore, believe our criteria to be more clinically relevant.

In our analysis of severe QTc prolongation, we could not sep-
arate the effects of epilepsy and use of depolarisation-blocking
drugs. Severe QTc prolongation was only present in people with
epilepsy and depolarisation-blocking drugs
( predominantly
AEDs) were used almost exclusively by this group. We believe
the use of depolarisation-blocking drugs is more likely a proxy
for epilepsy severity than directly affecting cardiac repolarisa-
tion. In this study, use of depolarisation-blocking drugs was not
related with severe QTc prolongation when analysing only the
cohort with epilepsy. Use of depolarisation-blocking AEDs was
not
associated with QTc prolongation in cross-sectional
studies,11–14 nor in a prospective drug trial.31 QT-prolonging
drugs are more likely to contribute to severe QTc prolongation,
but none of the individuals with this ECG risk marker used
these drugs.

In the multivariate analysis of ERP, we could separate the
effects of epilepsy and depolarisation-blocking drugs, and found
that the latter variable was not an independent determinant.
Due to the higher prevalence of this SCA risk marker in our
population, the evidence for the association of epilepsy with
ERP is stronger than with severe QTc prolongation.

Our ﬁndings might explain why people with epilepsy carry an
increased risk of SCA.1 ERP was associated with a 1.7-fold
increased risk of SCA in a recent meta-analysis,32 and seizures

Dichotomous data are expressed as n (%) unless indicated otherwise. ORs are calculated using penalised logistic regression analysis (R statistical package) for severe QTc prolongation
and logistic regression analysis for ERP. Covariates were entered in the analysis if they were associated (p<0.10) with pathological with severe QTc prolongation (see online
supplementary table e-1) or ERP (see online supplementary table e-2).
A: all determinants that were univariately associated with severe QTc prolongation (gender, age, heart rate) or ERP (gender, heart disease, QT-prolonging drugs, depolarisation-blocking
drugs, cardiovascular drugs, heart rate) were entered.
B: all determinants that changed the β by ≥5% and were univariately associated with severe QTc prolongation (gender, heart rate) or ERP (depolarisation-blocking drugs, heart rate)
and changed the β by ≥5% were entered.
ERP, early repolarisation pattern.

may facilitate the transition from ERP into Brugada ECG.33
Severe QTc prolongation is associated with a threefold increased
risk of SCA, which may be aggravated by additional peri-ictal
QTc prolongation.34 35

Severe QTc prolongation, ERP, and certain epilepsy syn-
dromes are associated with sodium and potassium channel
mutations.36 37 Conceivably, a single mutation expressed in
heart and brain might confer a propensity for epilepsy and an
innate vulnerability to cardiac arrhythmias, thereby linking epi-
lepsy with these ECG-markers and SCA.

Routine performance of a 12-lead ECG in all adults with sus-
pected epilepsy is recommended by the NICE guidelines but not
listed in the AES/AAN guidelines.23 38 The diagnostic yield of
this practice has not yet been determined. Our study suggests
that an increased prevalence of severe QTc prolongation and
ERP occurs in people with epilepsy. Routine ECG evaluation in
people with epilepsy may be of importance in guiding clinicians
in their choice of AED therapy, for example, avoidance of
QT-prolonging or depolarisation-blocking drugs in people with
ECG markers of increased SCA risk.
