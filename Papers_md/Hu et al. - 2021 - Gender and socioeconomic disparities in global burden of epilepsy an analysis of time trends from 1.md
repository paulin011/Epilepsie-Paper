Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate the gender and socioeconomic
disparities in the global burden of epilepsy by prevalence and disability-adjusted
life-years (DALYs).

Methods: The global, regional, and national gender-speciﬁc prevalence and DALYs
caused by epilepsy by year and age were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease
(GBD) Study 2017. The Gini coefﬁcient and concentration index (CI) were calculated to
demonstrate the trends in between-country inequality in the epilepsy burden from 1990
to 2017. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, Pearson correlation, and linear regression
analyses were performed to analyze the association of gender disparity in epilepsy and
socio-demographic index (SDI).

Results: The DALYs number of epilepsies increased from 1990 to 2017 by 13.8%,
whereas age-standardized DALY rates showed a substantial reduction (16.1%). Men
had a higher epilepsy burden than women of the same period. The epilepsy burden
appeared to be higher in countries with lower socioeconomic development (CI < 0).
The Gini coefﬁcient decreased from 0.273 in 1995 to 0.259 in 2017, representing a
decline in the between-country gap. Age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates of
men were higher than those of women in each SDI-based country group (p < 0.0001).
Male-minus-female difference (r = −0.5100, p < 0.0001) and male-to-female ratio (r
= −0.3087, p < 0.0001) of age-standardized DALY rates were negatively correlated
with SDI.

Conclusion: Although global health care of epilepsy is in progress, the epilepsy
burden was concentrated in males and developing countries. Our ﬁndings highlight the
importance of formulating gender-sensitive health policies and providing more services
in developing countries.

INTRODUCTION

Epilepsy is one of the most common and serious neurological
diseases, which remains an important cause of disability and
mortality, aﬀecting 50 million people worldwide (1). It is deﬁned
as a brain disorder characterized by an enduring predisposition to
generate epileptic seizure (2). Epilepsy aﬀects people of all ages,
particularly prevalent among infants and older age groups (1).
Health care (long-term treatment, hospitalization, and surgery)
and social services (social support and health education) lead
to high health costs (3). Therefore, in many parts of the world,
individuals living with epilepsy and their families suﬀer from a
high economic burden for health systems (4). Besides, the lives
of patients with epilepsy are impacted with social stigma and
discrimination (5).

Epilepsy burden has been measured by calculating disability-
adjusted life-years (DALYs; a summary measure of health loss
deﬁned by the sum of years of life lost due to premature mortality
and years lived with disability) in the Global Burden of Disease
(GBD) Study (6–8). Several studies have analyzed the gender
diﬀerence and socioeconomic disparity in epilepsy. In the GBD
2015 study (9), epilepsy contributed to 5.0% of total DALYs due
to neurological disorders and 1.3% of all deaths, with higher
DALY and prevalence rates in males. Worldwide, men had a
higher incidence of epilepsy compared with women (10). Men
were likely to be vulnerable to common risk factors such as
brain damage (11). In addition, women tended to have a lower
clinical consultation rate than men, especially in counties with
lower socioeconomic status (10, 12). Socioeconomic status is
related to inequality in the quality of medical care. Leonardi
et al. (13) ﬁrst attempted to quantify the global disparity in
the burden of epilepsy based on the GBD 2000 study. More
than 80% of people with epilepsy lived in developing countries
where epilepsy was not well-treated (14). The previous studies
have demonstrated that the lower socioeconomic status group
were more likely to develop epilepsy (15, 16). The incidence of
epilepsy in low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) was 139.0
(95% conﬁdence interval 69.4–278.2), while it was 48.9 (95%
conﬁdence interval 39.0–61.1) for high-income countries (HICs)
(17, 18). This association might be a result of less expenditure on
health care, lower education level, as well as a higher incidence of
risk factors such as infections and traumatic brain injury (19, 20).
Gender and socioeconomic disparities in epilepsy burden are
worth more attention in reducing the progression of epilepsy.
Existing studies have focused on the relationship between gender
or socioeconomic development and the prevalence and incidence
of epilepsy. However, there are few studies quantifying gender
and socioeconomic disparities in global epilepsy burden in
multiple dimensions. Epilepsy aﬀects people of all ages, sexes,
races, income groups, and geographical locations. About half
of the people with epilepsy have physical or mental illnesses.
Physical and mental comorbidities in people with epilepsy are
related to poorer health, increased health care demand, decreased
quality of life, and greater social exclusion (9). Our study analyzed
the global burden of epilepsy by year, age, sex, geography, and
socioeconomic status using prevalence and DALYs. In this study,
we aimed to assess the gender diﬀerences and compare the

Global Burden of Epilepsy

epilepsy burden across countries with diﬀerent socioeconomic
status, using the most recent data from the GBD 2017 study.

METHODS

Data Source
The GBD category of epilepsy is deﬁned by the International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD)-10 code G40 and G41. The GBD
2017 study collected data from typical surveys from 195 countries
and territories based on 354 diseases and injuries from 1990
to 2017. The GBD collaboration quantiﬁed health loss by age,
sex, and geography over time, using estimated prevalence and
DALYs. Methods to calculate DALYs estimates for the GBD 2017
study have been reported previously (21–24). We extracted data
from the Global Health Data Exchange (http://ghdx.healthdata.
org/gbd-data-tool) based on the GBD 2017 study, including
(1) global total and gender-speciﬁc burden due to epilepsy,
containing prevalence and DALYs number, prevalence and
DALYs per 100,000 population (crude rate) and age-standardized
prevalence and DALYs rate from 1990 to 2017; (2) global total
and gender-speciﬁc prevalence and DALYs rate by age group
in 2017; (3) gender-speciﬁc age-standardized prevalence and
DALYs rate in 21 GBD regions in 1990 and 2017; (4) DALYs
number and age-standardized DALYs rate in 195 countries and
territories in 2017. Ethics approval and informed consent were
not required for this study because of public accessibility to
the data.

Socioeconomic Status
The socio-demographic index (SDI) is a composite indicator of
development status, containing total fertility rate, educational
attainment, and lag-distributed income. The SDI varies from 0
to 1 strongly correlated with health outcomes, with a higher
value indicating a higher level of socioeconomic development
(22–24). Countries were categorized into ﬁve groups by their
overall development status level according to the 2017 SDI values
(25): high SDI (>0.81), high-middle SDI (0.70–0.81), middle SDI
(0.61–0.70), low-middle SDI (0.46–0.60), and low SDI (<0.46).

Health Inequalities
The Gini coeﬃcient and the concentration index (CI) were used
to quantify the magnitude of health inequalities in this study.
Based on the Lorenz Curve, the Gini coeﬃcient is a widely used
measure of the extent of inequality (26, 27). The Gini coeﬃcient
ranges from 0 to 1. A region with perfect equality will have a
value of 0, while a region with perfect inequality will have a
value of 1 (28). The Gini coeﬃcient is calculated by the age-
standardized DALY rates owing to epilepsy from 195 countries
to explore the trends in between-country health inequality from
1990 to 2017. The CI, derived from the concentration curve,
is commonly used as an index to measure the socioeconomic-
related inequalities (29). The CI is calculated by national age-
standardized DALY rates and the corresponding SDI to measure
the degree of health inequality associated with socioeconomic
conditions. The CI ranges from −1 to 1. A value of 0 for
CI means the absence of inequality related to socioeconomic
characteristics. A positive (negative) value of the CI indicates that

Global Burden of Epilepsy

the epilepsy burden is more concentrated in countries with high
(low) levels of socioeconomic development. The Gini coeﬃcient
was calculated by the INEQQERR module while the CI by the
CONCINDC module by using STATA 15 (StataCorp, College
Station, Texas, USA).

Statistical Analyses
All statistics were presented as values with 95% uncertainty
intervals (UIs). The Wilcoxon signed rank test
is a non-
parametric statistical hypothesis test when comparing two related
samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single
sample to assess whether their population mean ranks diﬀer.
The Wilcoxon signed rank test should be used if the diﬀerences
between pairs of data are non-normally distributed (30). The
Pearson correlation coeﬃcient measures the relative strength
of the linear relationship between two variables. Pearson’s r
ranges from −1 to 1. An r of −1 indicates a perfect negative
linear relationship, an r of 0 indicates no linear relationship,
and an r of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship
between variables (31). The paired Wilcoxon signed rank test was
utilized to compare gender diﬀerences in global age-standardized
prevalence and DALY rates for each SDI-based country group.
Association of gender diﬀerence (male minus female) and gender
ratio (male to female) in age-standardized DALY rates with SDI
was tested by Pearson correlation and linear regression analyses.
All the analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS 23.0 Statistical
software and Prism Software (version 8; GraphPad). A p < 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

Global Trends and Gender Disparity of
Epilepsy Burden
The all-age prevalence number due to epilepsy increased by
60.6%,
from 17.0 (95% UI: 13.0–21.5) million in 1990 to
27.3 (95% UI: 21.6–33.4) million in 2017 (Figure 1A). After
controlling for the eﬀect of population and age structure, age-
standardized prevalence rate of epilepsy rose by 13.6%, from
316.0 (95% UI: 244.4–399.3) per 100,000 population in 1990
to 359.1 (95% UI: 283.8–441.4) per 100,000 population in
2017 (Figure 1B). Similarly, the all-age DALYs number owing
to epilepsy increased from 13.0 (95% UI: 10.3–15.9) million
in 1990 to 14.8 (95% UI: 11.4–19.0) million in 2017, with
a rise of 13.8% (Figure 1C). After controlling for population
and age structure, a similar decline was observed in the age-
standardized DALY rate between 1990 and 2017 (Figure 1D).
Age-standardized DALY rate fell by 16.1% from 233.5 (95% UI:
186.4–285.9) per 100,000 population in 1990 to 195.8 (95% UI:
151.4–251.8) per 100,000 population in 2017. Among 21 GBD
regions, despite the substantial decline in DALY rates (Figure 2B;
Supplementary Table 1), a slight rise in the age-standardized
prevalence rate of epilepsy was observed for both sexes from 1990
to 2017 (Figure 2A).

As shown in Figure 1, gender disparities existed in global
burden of epilepsy since 1990, in the aspect of absolute number
(p < 0.001), crude rates (p < 0.001), and age-standardized rates
(p < 0.001) of DALYs. The total DALY numbers were 7.9 (95%

UI: 6.2–10.1) million in men and 6.8 (95% UI: 5.2–9.0) million in
women in 2017. Similarly, male subjects had a higher epilepsy
burden in the crude DALY rates (206.4 DALYs per 100,000
men vs. 180.7 DALYs per 100,000 women) and age-standardized
DALY rates (208.1 DALYs per 100,000 men vs. 183.5 DALYs
per 100,000 women) than females in 2017. In Figures 2A,B, the
greatest gender gap in DALY rate was found in Central Sub-
Saharan Africa (male 631.7 vs. female 356.3 in 1990, male 558.3
vs. female 309.7 in 2017), followed by Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa
and Western Sub-Saharan Africa regions.

Global Gender-Speciﬁc Epilepsy Burden by
Age
Age-speciﬁc prevalence rates of epilepsy reached a peak in the
95+ age group [817.2 (95% UI: 717.7–744.6] (Figure 1E). Three
peaks [1–4: 244.7 (95% UI: 195.2–313.0), 15–19: 237.3 (95% UI:
178.0–309.3), and 85–89 years: 221.2 (95% UI: 159.6–304.5)]
and a trough [50–54 years: 148.5 (95% UI: 116.3–191.0)] were
observed on the age-speciﬁc DALY rate in 2017 (Figure 1F).
Higher age-speciﬁc DALY rates were observed in males at all age
groups (p < 0.01).

Geographic Variation and Socioeconomic
Disparity in Epilepsy Burden
Among the 195 countries and territories analyzed in the
GBD 2017 study, there was considerable geographic variation
in the epilepsy burden worldwide (Figure 3). The epilepsy
burden concentrated in many Asian and African countries
with a large population and low socioeconomic status. As
shown in Figure 3A, DALYs number was greatest in India
[2,984,664.7 (95% UI: 2,409,842.9–3,681,587.1)], followed by
China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and United Status. Notably,
the
highest rate of age-standardized DALYs was concentrated in
the Central African Republic [525.1 (95% UI: 291.2–832.7)
per 100,000 population], followed by several African countries
such as Eritrea, Angola, Mozambique, and Congo (Figure 3B).
The lowest age-standardized DALY rate was concentrated in
developed countries in Asia and Europe, such as Japan [68.0
(95% UI: 42.2–107.0) per 100,000 population], Singapore, Spain,
Switzerland, and Sweden.

Figure 4 shows the time trends of the Gini coeﬃcient and CI.
The Gini coeﬃcients of epilepsy across countries decreased from
0.273 in 1995 to 0.259 in 2017 for the age-standardized DALY
rate (Figure 4A), indicating that the between-country disparity
of the epilepsy burden was declining. The negative values of
the CI indicated that epilepsy burden was more concentrated in
countries with lower socioeconomic development (Figure 4B).

The socio-demographic index (SDI) data in 2017 were
available for 195 countries and territories, including 35 in the
low SDI group, 41 in the low-middle SDI group, 40 in the
middle SDI group, 41 in the high-middle SDI group, and 38
in the high SDI group. In Figures 5A,B, each bubble represents
a country or a territory. The area of the bubble indicates the
absolute burden number in the diﬀerent SDI regions. The Y
coordinate represents the age-standardized burden rate. The
middle SDI and low-middle SDI regions suﬀered a higher burden

in terms of prevalence numbers and age-standardized prevalence
rates (Figure 5A), whereas the greatest DALY numbers and age-
standardized DALY rates were located in the low SDI and low-
middle regions (Figure 5B).

Males had higher age-standardized prevalence (p < 0.0001)
and DALY rates (p < 0.0001) than females in all ﬁve SDI regions
in 2017 (Figures 5C,D). Pearson correlation (r = −0.5100, p
< 0.001) and linear regression analysis (Y = −204.4 × X +
189.9) indicated that gender diﬀerences (male minus female) in
age-standardized DALY rates and SDI had a negative correlation
(Figure 5E). Similarly, gender ratios (male to female) in age-
standardized DALY rate were negatively associated with SDI
in Pearson correlation (r = −0.3087, p < 0.001) and linear
regression analysis (Y = −0.4525 × X + 1.568) (Figure 5F). Both
sets of analyses showed that gender diﬀerences in epilepsy DALY
rates were greater in countries with lower SDI.

DISCUSSION

Epilepsy has been a common public concern with a worldwide
distribution. Our analysis of the GBD 2017 study presented
that the global burden of epilepsy declined in terms of age-
standardized DALYs over the past decades. Epilepsy caused a
higher burden on adolescents and old people, especially in males.

Countries with lower socioeconomic status and underdeveloped
regions tended to have higher epilepsy burden and greater
gender gap.

Epilepsy accounts for a signiﬁcant proportion of the world’s
disease burden, with an increasing incidence in LMICs (49–215
per 1,000,000 people per year) (32–35). In this study, epilepsy
caused 14.8 million DALYs, which accounted for 0.59% of total
global DALYs in the GBD 2017 study. The DALYs numbers of
epilepsy were greatest in India and China. The increasing burden
in our results, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs,
might be partly due to rapidly aging and growing population,
rising life expectancy, and more risk factors (e.g., infections, birth
injury, trauma, and stroke) (19, 23). A high burden of epilepsy
has also been demonstrated in previous studies of speciﬁc regions
[South Africa (7), China (8), and southeast Nigeria (36)] by
using the DALY metrics. The number of patients with epilepsy
is expected to rise further, as more than 5 million new cases are
diagnosed each year (32). These ﬁndings necessitate more health-
care approaches of government for the management of epilepsy.
Despite a steadily growing tendency in the DALY number
of epilepsies, a reduction was observed in crude DALY rate
and age-standardized DALY rate between 1990 and 2017. This
is supported by a systematic analysis for the GBD 2016 study
(37), which found a signiﬁcant reduction in the mortality and

DALY rates in patients with epilepsy globally from 1990 to
2016. Similarly, the age-standardized DALYs of all neurological
disorders had an overall decrease between 1990 and 2015
(9). Factors contributing to the health improvement include
continuing progress in treatment conditions, advanced medical
technology, public awareness of epilepsy, and measures on
epilepsy prevention by the government (6, 37).

As shown in Figure 1F, after controlling for the eﬀect of
population, the DALY rate of epilepsy in 2017 had three peaks
in 1–4, 15–19, and 85–89 years old in 2017. These ﬁndings are
partially consistent with those of several previous studies (9, 38).
Epilepsy has a bimodal distribution according to age with peaks
in the youngest individuals and the elderly (9, 23). The higher
incidence of epilepsy in Europe occurs at 0–1 years old (39). The
incidence of epilepsy in resource-rich countries is highest in the
ﬁrst few months of life, particularly in the immediate postnatal
period, which falls signiﬁcantly after the 1st year of life (40).
The peak of DALY rate in young infants was probably due to
perinatal hypoxia and trauma, metabolic disturbances, congenital
malformations of the brain, and infection (19, 41). Inadequate
perinatal care and high premature mortality are possible reasons
for higher burden of epilepsy in infants. Perinatal and post-
infective encephalopathy, cortical dysplasia, and hippocampal
sclerosis account for the most severe symptomatic epilepsies
in children (42). Sillanpää et al. (43) found a 21.7-fold risk of

occurrence of a disability in children with epilepsy compared
with controls.

It is worth noting that the DALY rate also reaches a peak
in the adolescents in our ﬁndings. Similarly, the prevalence
rate of epilepsy had a peak during adolescence in Figure 1E.
A GBD study of epilepsy indicated that the years of life lost
(YLLs) of idiopathic epilepsy peaked at age under 5 years and
at age of 15–19 years (37). The probable etiology or risk factor
for epilepsy depends on the age of the patient and the type
of epilepsy (44). Myoclonic and absence seizures often occur
between 5 and 15 years old. Two thirds of the cases with
epilepsy were classiﬁed as idiopathic or cryptogenic, which is
usually seen in the adolescents (45). In adolescents, idiopathic
epilepsies account for the majority of cases, although trauma and
infection play a role. Most idiopathic epilepsy syndromes have
complex inheritance, probably because of interacting genetic and
environmental factors (46). Furthermore, Infants and adolescents
with epilepsy have diﬃculty in access to diagnosis and health care.
Stigmatization and poor acceptability of epilepsy impact on the
quality of life and long-term outcomes of infants and adolescents
with epilepsy (47).

Global Burden of Epilepsy

Moreover,

the most common causes in the elderly are
idiopathic epilepsy, trauma, head injury, alcohol abuse, brain
tumors, and cerebrovascular disease (46). Epilepsy is associated
with a number of age-related and aging-related diseases, such
as Alzheimer’s disease, dementias, stroke, and vascular and
metabolic disorders (23).

Our study revealed that gender disparities in epilepsy have
existed at a global level since 1990. In our study, signiﬁcantly
higher prevalence rates (p < 0.0001) and DALY rates (p <
0.0001) were found among males in diﬀerent SDI regions.
Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis indicated that
the greater sexual diﬀerences in epilepsy DALY rates appeared
in countries with lower SDI. Our ﬁndings provide data support
for the gender research of epilepsy. Several studies indicated that
the incidence of epilepsy was slightly higher in men than in
women (11, 48–50). Steroid hormones might be the potential
mechanism of gender diﬀerences in epilepsy (49). However, we
have not found the speciﬁc biological basis of sex disparity in
epilepsy in the previous literature (1, 11, 49), which needs further
studying. It has been suggested that males are more susceptible
to injury-induced seizures than females (49). Males have a higher
lifetime risk of suﬀering from epilepsy, and this might be owing to
men’s occupation and their exposure to risk factors, such as head
trauma and alcohol use. Additionally, because of the stigma and
low family economic status in rural areas, females tend to have a
lower consultation rate (10). Another survey (32) suggested that
women were more likely to conceal the symptoms of epilepsy for
sociocultural reasons in India.

More importantly, our ﬁndings pointed out that the burden of
epilepsy is higher in many developing regions with low SDI and
low-middle SDI, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and
Central and South Asia. The negative CI indicated that countries
with low levels of socioeconomic development had a higher
epilepsy burden. Epilepsy has a signiﬁcant economic impact on
health-care needs, premature death, and disruption of work or
education for individuals and their families (4, 51). A review of
studies estimating the cost of epilepsy reported that the direct and
indirect cost per person per year ranged from US$ 1,736 to 5,848
and 2,037 to 8,587, respectively (4). Several systematic studies
(32, 37, 52) have reported that there was an interconnection
between epilepsy and poverty. The lower socioeconomic status
was related to poor health services, poor awareness of medical
care, and infrequent outpatient clinic visits. The association
between lower socioeconomic status with a higher burden of
epilepsy in our study is in accordance with a review on epilepsy
in Asia (6). The median numbers of neurologists in Asia, a region
with great diﬀerences in economic development, were 0.03 and
2.96 per 100,000 population in low-income countries and high-
income countries, respectively. The high treatment gap, which
can be caused by inadequate health care response to epilepsy and
unaﬀordable drug treatment, resulted in diﬃculties in epilepsy
management in low-income regions. Moreover, the research
showed that the epilepsy burden of epilepsy-related premature
mortality is higher in LMICs than a burden in HICs (53).
Lack of access to medical facilities and preventable risk factors
(drowning, head injuries, and burns) in low-income countries
have promoted the occurrence of epilepsy.

Poor knowledge of epilepsy and less education also aﬀect the
burden of epilepsy. People in rural areas of Asia and Africa
tended to have more negative attitudes toward epilepsy than
those in developed countries (54, 55). Besides, patients with active
epilepsy living in low-income and middle-income countries
receive no timely and eﬀective treatment because the stigma
and discrimination are diﬃcult to overcome (56). The stigma
can impact the quality of life and work for patients and their

can be reduced by further education about epilepsy and improved
treatments, including antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

Comprehensive epilepsy care programs played an important
role in this decrease. Relevant projects in many countries,
such as China (57), India (58), and Brazil (59) have been
carried out to reduce the burden of epilepsy and improve
access to health-care services (11). Furthermore, the steady
rise of CI between 2000 and 2005 may also be associated with
the progress in health from the World Health Organization
(WHO) Program. Since 1997, the Global Campaign Against

To our knowledge, this study has provided a comprehensive
assessment of the global burden of epilepsy at a regional level
by using systematic and reliable GBD measures. Compared
with the previous studies on the global burden of epilepsy, our
study highlights and analyzes the gender and socioeconomic
disparities of global burden of epilepsy concretely. We discussed
not only the gender disparity by year, age, and region, but
also the relationship between gender diﬀerence and ratio in
the global burden of epilepsy with SDI. This is a more
speciﬁc perspective of discovering the gender disparity of
global burden of epilepsy. This study could help the decision-
makers to pay more attention to gender and socioeconomic-
related disparities in epilepsy burden. The long-term patterns
in gender and socioeconomic-related disparities in epilepsy
burden could be analyzed by the annual updates of
the
GBD study.

However, our study has several limitations. First, our research
is subject to the GBD 2017 study and therefore has the same
GBD methodological disadvantages, which have been described
previously (21, 23, 24, 33). Although the GBD 2017 study
provided estimates through hierarchical models by collecting
data from representative population-based studies, the quality
and availability of data are still
limited. Therefore, the data
sources and statistical assumptions may lead to bias in the
included literature. The selection and publication bias may
have contributed to the rise of CI between 2000 and 2005.
Second, most epidemiological research on epilepsy has been
done in high-income regions. There is an urgent need for more
research in low SDI regions to raise awareness of epilepsy.
Third, the impact of risk factors and speciﬁc classiﬁcation

of epilepsy on the epilepsy burden could be explored in a
further research.

CONCLUSION

The global epilepsy burden in terms of DALY rates had
substantial declines in the past decades. However, continuous
growth in DALY numbers indicates high costs of health care
in the future owing to the aging population. Males, especially
those who live in less developed countries, suﬀer a heavier burden
of epilepsy than females. A higher burden of epilepsy has been
found in countries with lower SDI. These ﬁndings could draw the
attention to the gender diﬀerence and geographical distribution
in global epilepsy burden and help to formulate health policies,
especially in developing countries, to reduce the gender gap and
burden of epilepsy.
