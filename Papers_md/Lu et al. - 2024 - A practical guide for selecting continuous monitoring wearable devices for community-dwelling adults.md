Importance: The burgeoning landscape of wearable devices warrants a guide for the selection of 
devices. Existing guidelines and recommendations provide evaluation frameworks with theoret-
ical principles but tend to lack a pragmatic application and systematic approach for device se-
lection. While fitness trackers exemplify the convenience of wearable technologies, their selection 
for specific health monitoring purposes demands a nuanced understanding of varying function-
alities and user compatibilities. 
Objective:  The  objective  is  to  develop  and  present  a  practical  guide  for  researchers,  healthcare 
professionals,  and  device  users  to  systematically  select  wearable  devices  for  continuous  moni-
toring in community-dwelling adults. 
Methods &  results: Based on diverse sources, such as the United States Food and Drug Adminis-
tration  (FDA),  the  Clinical  Trials  Transformation  Initiative  (CTTI),  the  Electronic  Patient- 
Reported Outcome (ePRO) Consortium, and comparative analyses of wearable technology per-
formances  from  feasibility  and  usability  studies,  the  guide  incorporates  five  core  criteria: 
continuous  monitoring  capability,  device  availability  and  suitability,  technical  performance 
(accuracy and precision), feasibility of use, and cost evaluation. The structured criteria can be 
applied in device selection as well as device evaluation. 
Conclusions:  This  practical  guide  provides  a  step-by-step  solution  for  researchers,  healthcare 
professionals, and device users to choose suitable wearable devices for continuous monitoring. It 
provides  a  comprehensive  starting  point,  outlining  how  to  effectively  navigate  the  selection 
process for wearable devices amidst a plethora of similar options.   

1. Introduction 

Digital health technologies, particularly consumer wearable devices, have emerged as popular tools for monitoring lifestyle habits 
and health status [1]. These devices, like fitness trackers, offer convenient and cost-effective solutions for remote data collection of 
mobility and vital signs, which are influenced by daily activities and behaviour [2]. Wearable devices with continuous monitoring

Lu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                            

technology,  such  as  continuous  glucose  monitors,  are  valuable  in  medical  research  for  consistent  data  collection  outside  clinical 
settings [3]. A variety of measurements are available, such as sleep patterns, physical activity, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation, 
that can supplement health assessments conducted during in-clinic visits [4]. The rapid pace of technological advancement produced a 
plethora of monitoring devices, making selecting a wearable device a daunting task due to the abundance of similar options [5]. 

The variety of wearable devices has burgeoned in the past decade [5,6], but there is a lack of a practical and user-centric guide for 
device selection. The choice of wearable device is dependent on the measurement objectives, user population, and available resources. 
Current frameworks and recommendations, including those from the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) [7], the 
Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) [8], and the Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome (ePRO) Consortium [9], provide 
foundational  theoretical  principles;  however,  they  tend  to  lack  a  pragmatic,  step-by-step  application  for  researchers,  healthcare 
professionals  (HCPs),  and  device  users  who  have  limited  knowledge  in  digital  health  to  select  wearable  devices  for  continuous 
monitoring [10]. Moreover, existing guidelines and evaluation frameworks do not offer a systematic approach to consider verification, 
validation, feasibility, and protocol design and execution, which are crucial in research and clinical settings or usage in daily life [11]. 
To address this gap, a practical guide offering a systematic approach with sequential steps and suggested evaluation metrics to 
selecting  wearable  devices  for  community-dwelling  adults  is  developed  and  presented.  It  aims  to  bridge  theoretical  advice  with 
actionable implementation and aid in navigating device selection. 

2. Methods 

2.1. Sources consulted 

To construct the selection guide for continuous monitoring wearable devices for use by community-dwelling adults, recommen-
dations from the US FDA [7], the CTTI [8,12], and the ePRO Consortium [9] were consulted. The FDA guidance outlines considerations 
for  digital  health  technology  usage  for  remote  data  acquisition  in  clinical  investigations  [7].  Finalized  in  December  2023,  their 
guidance for industry, investigators, and other stakeholders provides an overview of the considerations when using digital health 
technologies, such as digital health technology selection, regulatory submission, validation, usability, clinical outcome evaluation, 
statistical analysis, risks, and data management. The CTTI is a group of individuals and organizations with the mission of improving the 
quality and efficiency of clinical trials. Their recommendations focus on a framework of specifications to consider during digital health 
technology selection [12] as well as considerations for data capture during clinical trials (e.g., data collection, management, analysis, 
and interpretation and protocol design and execution) [8]. The ePRO Consortium included scientists and specialists from Critical Path 
Institute’s clinical outcome assessment and their pharmaceutical trial, development, and validation specialists. The recommendations 
pertained to the selection and evaluation of wearable devices and their measurements for use in regulatory trials [9]. To obtain an 
understanding of the available evaluation frameworks, the overview by Coravos et al. had been consulted [11]. They identified the 
source  (government,  academia,  or  industry),  evaluation  type  (organizational-  or  product-level),  product  audience  (pre-market  or 
post-market users), product scope (software or hardware evaluation), and evaluation criteria (verification and validation, data rights 
and  governance,  utility  and  usability,  and  economic  feasibility)  of  existing  frameworks  that  are  used  for  risk-benefit  analyses  of 
connected technologies. They also provided design principles for reference when constructing the current practical guide, such as 
including objective, observable, and verifiable criteria in an evaluation process that is contextual and multidimensional [11]. While 
existing frameworks often offer generalized considerations and thresholds, the distinctiveness of this practical guide lies in its pro-
vision of a detailed, step-by-step methodology, akin to a recipe. The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Mea-
surement INstruments (COSMIN) Risk of Bias tool was integrated to ensure a procedure for evaluating technical performance and 
validation was included [13]. To incorporate vital considerations that shape the users’ perceptions of device acceptability and usability 
into  the  practical  guide,  comparative  analyses  of  device  performance  and  user  experience  from  feasibility  and  usability  studies 
[14–19], along with recommendations from the ePRO Consortium, were consulted to identify the parameters for evaluating feasibility 
of use. 

2.2. Development of the selection guide 

A wearable device is a compact electronic device equipped with sensors that can be worn on the body or integrated into clothing 
and other body-worn accessories [20]. These devices are able to remotely, non-/minimally-invasively, and longitudinally monitor 
essential physiological and biochemical measurements [20]. The practical guide comprises five core criteria for selecting wearable 
devices:  continuous  monitoring  capability,  device  suitability  and  availability,  technical  performance  (accuracy  and  precision), 
feasibility of use, and cost evaluation. These criteria are sequentially incorporated to evaluate the wearable device for continuous 
monitoring in community-dwelling adults. At each criterion, the guide gradually helps to define the context for use, which enable a 
multidimensional evaluation yet systematic selection of a suitable device. Continuous monitoring is important for uninterrupted and 
consistent data collection of measurements with high variance and to understand an individual’s daily activities and behaviour [21]. 
Ensuring continuous monitoring capability aligns with the goal of using wearable devices to capture health and behaviour longitu-
dinally and passively outside of clinical settings [20]. The device availability and suitability criterion helps to maximize the device’s 
lifetime of usage and considers the logistical aspects of using the device daily [14]. Evaluating this criterion next ensures the relevancy 
and reliability of the wearable device as well as the suitability for integration into the daily lives of community-dwelling adults [1]. 
Technical performance (accuracy and precision) facilitates the collection of high-quality data, forming the basis for analytical insights. 
The reliability and validity of collected data ensures that the outcomes and insights derived are accurate representations of physiology 

Heliyon10(2024)e334882J.K. Lu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                            

and behaviour [21]. Feasibility of use aims to enhance user experience, promoting high compliance/adherence by ensuring device 
user-friendliness. This is a critical consideration in the context of device usage by community-dwelling adults, where factors such as 
user acceptance, device usability, and data relevancy play pivotal roles in the success of monitoring initiatives [22]. This criterion 
additionally  addresses  monitoring  needs  in  research  and  clinical  settings,  identifying  devices  that  can  seamlessly  integrate  into 
workflows for researchers and HCPs [3,8,11]. Cost evaluation is crucial for making informed and financially sustainable decisions, 
ensuring that needs align with financial constraints and economic value can be optimized [11]. 

In the practical guide, a holistic approach is adopted to evaluate a comprehensive set of criteria, ensuring user-centric design for 
researchers and HCPs during the device selection process. By prioritizing the feasibility of use as a core criterion, researchers and HCPs 
can choose wearable devices with the device end-user in mind, additionally ensuring that user needs are understood and incorporated 
into the device selection process. 

3. Results 

The wearable device selection guide (Fig. 1) facilitates the selection and evaluation of continuous monitoring wearable devices for 
community-dwelling adults. It can be used for selection from a list of devices or for evaluation of one specific device. Detailed defi-
nitions and descriptions for how to evaluate each criterion are in Table 1. 

3.1. Criterion 1: continuous monitoring capability 

Adapted from FDA guidance [7], this criterion selects devices capable of continuous monitoring. If devices do not facilitate passive

measurement (i.e., without user interaction) and data collection over 24 hours a day for seven days minimum, they are less ideal as 
devices without continuous monitoring are not considered in this guide. 

3.2. Criterion 2: device availability and suitability 

The evaluation of the availability and suitability criterion is derived from recommendations from the ePRO Consortium [9]. The 
availability of a device (discontinuation of or obsolete (i.e., outdated) models and stage in the device development cycle) and its 
suitability (such as invasiveness, bulkiness, and interference with activities of daily living [17]) will affect the logistics and operations 
of using the device for researchers, HCPs, and device users.

3.3. Criterion 3: technical performance (accuracy and precision) 

The third criterion evaluates devices for the accuracy (measurement error) and precision (reliability) of measurements of interest. 
Examples of measurements include cardiometabolic, neurological, activity and sleep, and psychological biomarkers [25]. This cri-
terion is based on guidance from the FDA [7], recommendations from the CTTI [12], and the verification, analytical validation, and 
clinical validation (V3) framework [16]. This criterion utilizes the COSMIN Risk of Bias tool for the definitions of sufficient accuracy 

Fig. 2. Example of the wearable device selection process for heart rate monitoring. (A) The objective is to monitor heart rate, with five device 
options: an oscillometric automatic blood pressure monitor, a Holter monitor, two smartwatches with optical heart rate sensors, one from Brand X 
and one from Brand Y, and a smart ring with an optical heart rate sensor. The options are assumed to be representative of the types of devices 
available on the market for illustrative purposes. The blood pressure monitor is excluded as it cannot provide continuous monitoring. The Holter 
monitor is excluded due to its bulkier recording device, making it unsuitable for daily use. Based on validation studies in peer-reviewed articles, if 
the device heart rate measurement is inaccurate, then it would be excluded (e.g., smartwatch Brand Y). Smartwatch Brand X and the smart ring are 
included in the next evaluation phase as their heart rate measurements are accurate. (B) Each feasibility parameter is evaluated and rated as high, 
medium, or low feasibility, with explanations provided. The cost per device is included for a comprehensive assessment. Although the parameters 
are not linearly additive, summing the number of high feasibility ratings (green circles) can serve as a proxy for identifying a suitable continuous 
monitoring device. In this example, despite the higher cost, the smart ring demonstrates the highest feasibility for continuous heart rate monitoring 
in  a  healthy  adult  population.  For  clarity  and  brevity,  device  details  and  the  selection  process  have  been  simplified.  (For  interpretation  of  the

Heliyon10(2024)e334885J.K. Lu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                            

and precision [13]. International guidelines (e.g., US Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/European Society 
of Hypertension/International Organization for Standardization (AAMI/ESH/ISO) or British Hypertension Society guidelines for blood 
pressure measuring devices) should be used if available. Using validation data from peer-reviewed articles and usage and specifications 
information from the manufacturer are recommended during device evaluation [11]. Devices can be considered if they are accurate 
and  precise  or  accurate  with  indeterminate  precision/imprecise.  Devices  are  not  considered  if  the  gold/reference  standard  and 
COSMIN criteria were not used, or the measurement of interest was not validated. 

3.4. Criterion 4: feasibility of use 

Combining insights from usability studies [14,15,17,18] with the CTTI recommendations [12], this criterion ensures the device 
selected would be user-centric and user-friendly based on five parameters (measurements validated, population validated, accept-
ability, usability, and battery life) and addresses workflow needs in research and clinical settings based on four parameters (device 
setup/maintenance, data management, firmware/software updates, and data access) (Fig. 1). Each feasibility parameter is categorised 
into high, medium, or low feasibility for usage of the device to provide a relative scale for comparison. 

3.5. Criterion 5: cost evaluation 

Built upon recommendations from the CTTI and Coravos et al., this criterion considers economic aspects for making informed 
decisions  in  device  selection  [11,12].  Possible  costs  include  the  costs  for  the  device,  for  related  management  systems,  for  usage 
subscriptions, and/or for software platform licenses. 

Fig. 2 presents a step-by-step example of the wearable device selection process using hypothetical devices for heart rate monitoring. 
The flowchart illustrates decision-making at each criterion, starting with the exclusion of unsuitable devices (Fig. 2A) and culminating 
in the evaluation of feasibility parameters and cost (Fig. 2B). This example simplifies the details and characteristics of the devices and 
steps for clarity, providing a clear and practical application of the guide. 

4. Discussion 

A  practical  guide  for  selecting  wearable  devices  for  continuous  monitoring  in  community-dwelling  adults  was  developed, 
comprising five core criteria: continuous monitoring capability, device availability and suitability, technical performance (accuracy 
and precision), feasibility, and cost evaluation. The guide can be applied both to select a device from a list of potential devices and to 
evaluate a single device. 

Existing guidelines, including the FDA draft guidance [7], the CTTI framework [12], and recommendations from the ePRO Con-
sortium [9], served as foundational sources to establish this guide. Existing guidelines focused on usage of digital health technologies 
in clinical investigations [7] and  clinical trials [8].  Hence, they lack practical application  and selection  considerations  for use in 
community-dwelling adults. Recommendations from the ePRO Consortium provided a sequential list of factors influencing device 
suitability [9] in regulatory clinical trials and may, therefore, be inadequate to use for other indications or selecting a device for 
continuous monitoring in daily life. Additionally, these guidelines all have different definitions of digital health technologies, some 
including digital applications, wearable devices, and other portable technologies containing sensors for remote data acquisition [8], all 
of which may have different selection criteria. Meanwhile, this practical guide recommends a systematic yet adaptable approach that 
caters specifically to the selection of wearable devices for continuous monitoring in community-dwelling adults. 

This practical guide is designed to enable researchers, HCPs, and device users to identify what may be suitable for continuous and 
longitudinal  monitoring  using  a  systematic  process.  However,  this  is  a  suggested  systematic  process  because  depending  on  the 
monitoring  objectives, user  population, and  available resources,  users of  the  guide  can put  weighted  emphasis  or  importance  on 
different criteria. For example, the requirement for some core criteria could be valuing and evaluating feasibility before technical 
performance (e.g., if the user population entails higher acceptability and usability of the device with a longer battery life) or prioritize 
costs as the paramount deciding factor (e.g., if financial resources are limited). Data management and device setup/maintenance are 
essential parameters for researchers and HCPs to evaluate and plan for, but it may not be crucial for device users to consider if they do 
not need to routinely export and clear existing data to set up devices for new users [18]. Nonetheless, using a practical guide can foster 
clarity and transparency in decision-making, facilitating communication among researchers, HCPs, and device users to identify the 
best practices for selecting and implementing wearable devices. While the applicability of the practical guide is currently theoretical, 
empirical validation in the future can verify the effectiveness of the practical guide in real-world settings. 

4.1. Strengths and limitations 

The  technological  life  cycle  of  digital  devices  entails  rapid  obsolescence  of  hardware  and  software  [26],  which  is  constantly 
upgraded and redesigned to newer models. One strength of this guide lies in its adaptability to accommodate the evolving landscape of 
wearable  technologies.  As  new  devices  and  technologies  emerge,  the  guide’s  criteria  can  be  adapted  to  accommodate  novel  in-
novations and considerations. Additionally, the systematic approach streamlines the device selection process and minimizes the risk of 
selecting inappropriate devices, thereby optimizing resource allocation. Furthermore, the guide’s considerations of both technical 
performance and user experience promotes the selection of devices that are not only accurate but also well-received by users, which 
facilitates high compliance/adherence. From a technological innovation perspective, the practical guide can also serve as a reference 

Heliyon10(2024)e334886J.K. Lu et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                            

point  or  benchmark  for  device  designers  and  manufacturers/engineers,  providing  suggestions  for  evaluation  components  of 
user-friendly devices and improvements to hardware and software to enhance data quality. 

It is noted that device selection considerations out of scope are social/psychological factors that could translate to cultural pref-
erences that may affect device acceptability and usability [14]. Social/psychological factors should be incorporated into the device 
selection process according to specific monitoring needs and circumstances of the intended target population. Additionally, the guide 
relies  on  the  availability  of  validation  data  from  peer-reviewed  articles  as  well  as  usage  and  specifications  information  from  the 
manufacturer. These validation data ensure a fair comparison across devices; however, they may not always be readily accessible. 
While the guide’s criteria are modular and can be adapted to address novel innovations and considerations, there remains the chal-
lenge of who will update the guide and how regularly it will be updated in response to the rapid technological advancements in 
wearable devices. 

Future directions include validating this practical guide by disseminating the guide to users and obtaining feedback on the usability 
of the guide. Various research teams, healthcare providers, and community-dwelling device users could be invited to form focus groups 
or a consortium to identify areas of the practical guide for revision and improvement. The feedback and testing would help improve the 
guide’s user-friendliness and applicability in different contexts, increasing the user-centricity of the guide. Moreover, the entire se-
lection process could be developed into a web or mobile application where users can input their measurement objectives and user 
needs to obtain recommendations of suitable devices. This endeavour may need to be developed and maintained by a non-profit 
organization with no conflicts of interest or biases towards recommending certain devices. 

5. Conclusions 

Overall,  there  is  an  abundance  of  digital  health  technologies,  and  the  variety  is  likely  to  increase  further  with  the  rapid 
advancement of technologies. A practical guide on the selection of suitable wearable devices for continuous monitoring in community- 
dwelling adults includes evaluating continuous monitoring, device availability and suitability, technical performance, feasibility, and 
costs. This guide, while providing a structured approach for device selection, also opens avenues for exploring personalized health 
monitoring strategies in diverse community settings. The proposed selection process provides a systematic approach that researchers, 
healthcare professionals, and device users can apply and implement.
