ABSTRACT
Introduction  Selection of antiseizure medications (ASMs) 
for newly diagnosed epilepsy remains largely a trial- and- 
error process. We have developed a machine learning 
(ML) model using retrospective data collected from five 
international cohorts that predicts response to different 
ASMs as the initial treatment for individual adults with 
new- onset epilepsy. This study aims to prospectively 
evaluate this model in Australia using a randomised 
controlled trial design.
Methods and analysis  At least 234 adult patients 
with newly diagnosed epilepsy will be recruited from 
14 centres in Australia. Patients will be randomised 1:1 
to the ML group or usual care group. The ML group will 
receive the ASM recommended by the model unless it 
is considered contraindicated by the neurologist. The 
usual care group will receive the ASM selected by the 
neurologist alone. Both the patient and neurologists 
conducting the follow- up will be blinded to the group 
assignment. Both groups will be followed up for 52 weeks 
to assess treatment outcomes. Additional information on 
adverse events, quality of life, mood and use of healthcare 
services and productivity will be collected using validated 
questionnaires. Acceptability of the model will also be 
assessed.
The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants 
who achieve seizure- freedom (defined as no seizures 
during the 12- month follow- up period) while taking the 
initially prescribed ASM. Secondary outcomes include 
time to treatment failure, time to first seizure after 
randomisation, changes in mood assessment score and 
quality of life score, direct healthcare costs, and loss of 
productivity during the treatment period.
This trial will provide class I evidence for the effectiveness 
of a ML model as a decision support tool for neurologists 
to select the first ASM for adults with newly diagnosed 
epilepsy.
Ethics and dissemination  This study is approved by 
the Alfred Health Human Research Ethics Committee 

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ Multisite,  prospective,  double- blind,  randomised, 
controlled trial of a machine learning model for an-
tiseizure medication (ASM) selection for newly diag-
nosed epilepsy.

 ⇒ Besides measuring the cost- effectiveness of apply-
ing the machine learning model, the acceptance of 
machine learning- assisted clinical decision support 
will  be  explored  among  different  stakeholders,  in-
cluding both patients and neurologists.

 ⇒ The trial confines the choice of drug to seven com-
monly  prescribed  ASMs,  limiting  the  flexibility  of 
neurologists who may have prescription preference 
outside the repertoire.

 ⇒ The  inclusion  criteria  of  aged  18–67  specifically 
exclude  the  older  adult  epilepsy  cohort  who  have 
a  high  prevalence  of  epilepsy  along  with  distinct 
health and social needs that could be alleviated by 
optimised initial ASM selection.

 ⇒ The model is used both on patients with generalised 
epilepsy or focal epilepsy, planned subgroup analy-
sis is limited to these two epilepsy types and does 
not include more specific aetiologies.

(Project 130/23). Findings will be presented in academic 
conferences and submitted to peer- reviewed journals for 
publication.

INTRODUCTION
Epilepsy is a common chronic, serious neuro-
logical  disorder  that  affects  all  age  groups 
and  ethnicities  worldwide.  Over  50 million 
people are living with epilepsy, accounting for 
13 million  disability- adjusted  life- years.1  Anti-
seizure medications (ASMs) are the mainstay

of  epilepsy  therapy,  with  the  primary  goal  of  achieving 
the  best  possible  quality  of  life  by  maximising  seizure 
control  and  minimising  adverse  effects.2  3  For  a  newly 
diagnosed patient, it is recommended to start an ASM as 
monotherapy. In the current treatment paradigm, a clini-
cian selects an ASM according to the patient’s character-
istics  including  demographics,  epilepsy  type/syndrome, 
comorbidities,  while  also  considering  the  ASM  efficacy 
spectrum and tolerability/safety profile. There are more 
than 20 ASMs available; among those approved for use as 
monotherapy, none has shown overwhelming superiority 
in terms of efficacy and tolerability.4 Choosing the ideal 
ASM for an individual can be a subjective and even biased 
process. There is no reliable biomarker to predict which 
ASM will be the most effective for an individual patient. 
As  a  result,  people  with  epilepsy  can  undergo  multiple 
trials  of  various  medication  regimens  before  attaining 
seizure freedom.5 The consequence can be years of poor 
quality of life,6 productivity loss7 and even increased risk 
of mortality.8

Failure  of  the  first  ASM  is  the  strongest  predictor  of 
long- term drug resistance and poor health outcomes.9 10 
Choosing  the  first  ASM  is  arguably  the  most  important 
decision  to  be  made  in  the  management  of  newly  diag-
nosed  epilepsy  from  the  perspectives  of  both  clinical 
outcome  and  the  patient’s  preference.  Hence,  it  would 
be of great clinical value if the most effective one could 
be prescribed at the outset instead of going through the 
current trial- and- error process.

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelli-
gence (AI). It has the advantages in recognising hidden 
patterns in input variables and making meaningful predic-
tions. Our group has recently developed a deep learning 
model, a type of ML model with multiple layers, that used 
16 structured clinical variables to predict the effectiveness 
of  ASMs  in  adults  with  newly  diagnosed  epilepsy.11  The 
model was trained and tested on five independent cohorts 
from four countries (UK, Malaysia, Australia, and China) 
totalling 1798 patients. It was trained to predict and rank 
the  likelihood  of  treatment  success  (seizure  freedom  at 
12 months without intolerable adverse effects) of each of 
the seven predefined ASMs (which include the most used 
ASMs in Australia) as the first monotherapy for an indi-
vidual patient. This ability is illustrated in 100 randomly 
selected individuals from the pooled cohort in the online 
supplemental figure. Using the observed response to the 
prescribed ASM as the ‘ground truth’, our model outper-
formed five other traditional ML and deep learning algo-
rithms in the prediction.

We  have  improved  this  model  by  applying  natural 
language processing (NLP) to extract information from 
the text of electroencephalography (EEG) and MRI brain 
reports. The NLP output is incorporated as supplemen-
tary  input  alongside  the  structured  clinical  variables  to 
develop  a  multimodality  ML  model.  Consideration  was 
made regarding the inclusion of sleep EEG reports, while 
they  are  not  precluded  from  use  in  place  of  a  routine 
EEG,  for  pragmatic  reasons  they  have  not  been  made 

2

mandatory. The improved model was reoptimised using 
datasets from Australian and international cohorts. Ulti-
mately, the effectiveness of applying such a model in clin-
ical practice would require prospective evaluation.

This  article  describes  the  protocol  of  a  randomised 
controlled  trial  (RCT)  that  aims  to  evaluate  the  clinical 
effectiveness of the multimodality ML model in selecting 
the first ASM for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy. The 
trial will also assess the cost- effectiveness and acceptance 
of the model to patients and neurologists. This protocol 
follows  the  Standard  Protocol  Items:  Recommendations 
for Interventional Trials- AI extension guidelines for clin-
ical trials of interventions involving AI.12

METHODS AND ANALYSIS
Study design and setting
This  is  a  multicentre,  randomised,  controlled,  patient 
and  assessor  blinded  trial  conducted  in  Australia.  It  is 
considered ‘first- in- class’ as the first RCT of an ML model 
in  epilepsy  management.  Adults  of  working  age  with 
newly  diagnosed  epilepsy  will  be  referred  to  the  study 
by their treating clinicians. Participants will be recruited 
from  14  epilepsy  centres  across  5  Australian  states  from 
14 February 2024 to 13 February 2026.

Intervention
The intervention in this study is known as EpiMD, a clin-
ical  decision  support  software  developed  to  assist  the 
neurologist in selecting the first ASM. EpiMD is a multi-
modality  ML  model  using  the  deep  learning  technique 
known  as  multilayer  perceptron.  A  multilayer  percep-
tron  is  focused  on  mapping  the  relationships  between 
different variables.13 EpiMD includes clinical variables, as 
well as annotated EEG and MRI brain reports that have 
undergone NLP. Using these inputs, EpiMD will recom-
mend  the  ASM  monotherapy  (from  a  group  of  seven 
possible choices) with which the participant is predicted 
to  have  the  highest  probability  of  achieving  seizure 
freedom  for  the  12  months  following  ASM  commence-
ment.  After  consultation  with  the  site  investigators,  the 
implementation of EpiMD will include a filter to prevent 
the recommendation of sodium valproate for women of 
childbearing age (defined in this study as between 18 and 
45  years  of  age)  owing  to  the  medication’s  teratogenic 
risk. No other filtering will be applied.

Eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria for participants are the following: aged 
18–67  years,  capacity  to  self- consent,  fluent  in  English, 
diagnosis  of  epilepsy  consistent  with  the  International 
League  Against  Epilepsy  (ILAE)  definition.14  This  is 
operationally defined as having had at least two seizures 
within the past 12 months, or one seizure within the past 
6 months  and  epileptiform  discharges  on  EEG,  or  pres-
ence of epileptogenic lesion on CT or MRI. Routine EEG 
and MRI brain done within 2 years prior to randomisation

is also required. The routine EEG can (but is not specifi-
cally required to) be replaced with a sleep EEG.

Exclusion  criteria  for  participants  are  the  following: 
previously  treated  epilepsy  or  current  ASM  use  for 
more  than  14  days,  pregnant  or  breastfeeding,  current 
substance abuse disorder that may affect treatment adher-
ence/response,  inability  to  undergo  EEG/MRI  brain 
due to contraindication, presence of functional seizures, 
presence  of  progressive  central  nervous  system  disease, 
serious hepatic or renal disease, or terminal cancer that 
would affect assessment of response to ASMs.

Recruitment procedures
Figure 1 shows the recruitment pathway. Treating neurol-
ogists will prospectively identify participants from outpa-
tient  clinics  and  inpatient  wards  using  the  eligibility 
criteria. Participants who meet the criteria will be referred 
to the study coordinator, who will contact the patient to 
explain all details of the study in addition to providing a 
copy of the patient information and consent form (PICF). 
If the participant is interested in taking part in the study, 
a  baseline  study  visit  in  the  presence  of  a  neurologist 
acting as an investigator will be conducted via video link 
or in- person within 2 weeks of the initial referral.

At  the  baseline  visit,  if  all  the  eligibility  criteria  are 
fulfilled,  the  PICF  will  be  signed  by  the  participant 
and  investigator.  The  baseline  questionnaires  will  be 
completed by the participant, guided by the neurologist 
and study coordinator, to collect clinical variables along-
side  diagnostic  test  reports  from  the  patient  electronic 
medical  record  (EMR).  Additionally,  the  content  and 
utilisation  of  both  the  seizure  diary  and  the  healthcare 
use  diary  that  will  be  completed  at  follow- up  visits  will 
be explained to the participant. Study data are collected 

and  managed  using  Research  Electronic  Data  Capture 
(REDCap)  tool  hosted  and  managed  by  Helix  (Monash 
University).15  16  REDCap  is  a  secure,  web- based  software 
platform  designed  to  support  data  capture  for  research 
studies. It provides an intuitive interface for validated data 
capture  and  audit  trails  for  tracking  data  manipulation 
and export procedures. REDCap will be used to automate 
the  export  procedures  for  data  downloads  to  common 
statistical packages and the procedures for data integra-
tion and interoperability with external sources. The trial 
REDCap  is  updated  anytime  the  model  is  utilised,  and 
therefore,  is  suitable  to  meet  our  obligations  regarding 
data management and site monitoring.

Randomisation and ASM prescription
The  participant  will  be  randomised  1:1  into  either  the 
experimental  (ML  group)  or  the  control  group  (usual 
care  group)  using  individual  randomisation  centralised 
and in blocks that are stratified by both seizure type (focal 
vs generalised onset) and study site. In the experimental 
group, EpiMD will be run using the information provided 
and respond with the ASM recommendation. The inves-
tigator will prescribe the recommended ASM unless it is 
considered to be contraindicated due to safety reasons. In 
this case, the investigator will prescribe a different ASM 
and provide their reasoning for doing so. In the control 
group,  the  recommendation  by  the  ML  model  will  not 
be  revealed,  and  the  investigator  will  prescribe  an  ASM 
based only on their clinical judgement.

Any out- of- pocket costs associated with new generation 
ASMs used as monotherapy that are not covered by the 
Pharmaceutical  Benefits  Scheme  will  be  reimbursed  to 
the participants. ASM prescription will be open label for 
both  groups.  Guidance  regarding  the  rate  of  titration,

initial maintenance dose and any subsequent increments 
or decrements will be made available to the prescribing 
clinician. If the patient is taking an ASM prior to rando-
misation,  the  drug  will  be  ceased  over  2–4 weeks  under 
the supervision of the treating neurologist.

Blinding
Both the participant receiving treatment and the neurol-
ogist assessing outcomes at follow- up visits will be blinded 
as  to  which  group  the  participant  has  been  assigned; 
however, neither the patient nor the treating neurologist 
will be blinded to the ASM that is being taken. Blinding 
will  be  maintained  through  either  of  two  methods.  In 
method 1, the referring neurologist will act as the inves-
tigator  at  the  baseline  visit  and  prescribe  the  ASM,  and 
different  neurologist(s)  will  perform  all  subsequent 
follow- up. In method 2, a neurologist different from the 
referring one will prescribe the ASM at the baseline visit, 
and the referring neurologist will perform all subsequent 
follow- up.  This  allows  the  continuity  of  care  at  partici-
pating epilepsy clinics to be maintained.

Follow-up procedures
Prior  to  a  scheduled  study  visit,  participants  will  be 
sent  a  REDCap  survey  invitation  to  the  email  they  have 
provided. This email includes a link to a series of surveys 
associated  with  the  upcoming  visit  as  listed  in  table  1. 
These  will  be  limited  to  only  the  seizure  diary  and  the 
Liverpool  Adverse  Events  Profile  (LAEP)  for  the  minor 
follow- up visits (8 weeks, 16 weeks and 40 weeks). For the 
major visits (28 weeks and 52 weeks), the patient will also 
complete surveys on mood, quality of life, healthcare util-
isation  and  productivity.  During  the  follow- up  visits,  the 
surveys  will  be  reviewed  for  completion  and  discussed 
with the participant. If assistance is required, the partic-
ipants can opt to complete the surveys together with the 
neurologist  and  the  study  coordinator  during  follow- up 
visits.

Collection of saliva samples
The PICFs contain additional opt- in consent to the collec-
tion  of  a  DNA  sample  for  use  in  the  current  research 
only, future related research only, or any future research. 
Participants  who  opt  in  will  be  mailed  a  DNA  Genotek 
OG- 50017 self- administered saliva collection kit from the 
lead  site  with  prepaid  return  postage.  On  return  of  the 
saliva sample, DNA extraction will be performed and the 
extracted  DNA  will  be  labelled  according  to  the  partic-
ipants’  study  number  without  any  identifying  informa-
tion. The labelled DNA sample will be stored in a locked 
freezer at Monash University for future use.

Participant safety and withdrawal
While this is a clinical trial involving the use of medica-
tion, the intervention in question is EpiMD rather than 
a  new  compound.  Additionally,  while  for  the  ML  group 
drug  selection  is  guided  by  EpiMD,  the  ultimate  deci-
sion lies with the neurologist. As such, the potential for 
an adverse reaction to the prescribed treatment beyond 
standard clinical care is low and is not expected to pose 
extra risk to participants. Adverse events will be systemati-
cally collected using the LAEP.18 Clinicians can enter free 
text to describe any adverse effects in the REDCap. The 
adverse  reactions  will  be  coded  by  standardised  termi-
nology  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regula-
tory  Activities.19  Participants  are  free  to  withdraw  from 
the study at any time, for any reason, without prejudice. If 
a participant withdraws from the study early, their reason 
for early termination will be recorded in the study record.

Primary outcomes
The  primary  outcome  is  the  proportion  of  participants 
who achieve treatment success defined as seizure freedom 
while taking the prescribed ASM for the duration of the 
12- month  follow- up  period.  This  outcome  is  consistent 
with  the  ILAE  and  European  Medicines  Agency  guide-
lines for ASM monotherapy trials.20 This outcome is also

clinically  relevant  given  that  seizure  freedom  is  associ-
ated  with  improvement  in  quality  of  life  in  people  with 
epilepsy.2

Secondary outcomes
 ► Treatment  failure  is  defined  as  withdrawal  of  the 
initial  ASM  or  the  commencement  of  polytherapy 
with a second ASM, whichever is earliest.
 ► Time to first seizure after treatment initiation.
 ► Direct healthcare costs will be assessed through review 
of a participant managed diary at both 28 weeks and 
52- week post- treatment collection.

 ► Indirect healthcare costs will be assessed as a measure 
of  productivity  loss  determined  from  the  Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment–General Health 
questionnaire, collected at baseline, 28 weeks and 52 
weeks post- treatment commencement.

 ► The  incidence  of  depression  and  anxiety  will  be 
assessed  through  changes  to  HADS  scores21  over 
the  treatment  period,  which  will  be  collected  at 
baseline,  28  weeks  and  52  weeks  post- treatment 
commencement.

 ► Comparison  of  the  proportion  of  participants  who 
achieve a minimum increase of 12 points in the Quality 
of  Life  in  Epilepsy- 31  (QOLIE- 31)  as  a  measure  of 
quality  of  life,22  supported  by  the  general  European 
Quality  of  Life- 5  Dimensions- 5  Level  (EQ- 5D- 5L) 
survey,23  both  of  which  are  collected  at  baseline,  28 
weeks and 52 weeks post- treatment commencement.
 ► To assess clinical and participant acceptance of using 
ML to select the first ASM, participants and neurolo-
gists involved in the trial will be invited to take part in 
an optional process evaluation, involving:
 – A  study- specific  questionnaire  developed  based 
on  the  Unified  Theory  of  Acceptance  and  Use  of 
Technology 2.24

 – Qualitative interviews of 25% of study patients and 

25% of study neurologists.

Economic evaluation
Within- trial  analysis  of  cost- effectiveness  will  compare 
differences in combined direct and indirect costs between 
the ML and usual care against differences for both quality- 
adjusted  life- years  and  the  1- year  seizure  freedom  rate. 
To  ensure  real- world  relevance,  prospective  trial  data 
will  be  analysed  using  the  utility  score  indices  from  the 
EQ- 5D- 5L  and  QOLIE- 31  overall  score.  This  approach 
has been used in a previous health economic evaluation 
in epilepsy.25 If the results from this analysis indicate an 
increase  in  the  seizure- free  rate  and  quality  of  life,  or  a 
reduction  in  costs,  extrapolation- based  analysis  over  an 
extended  time- horizon  will  be  performed  where  costs 
and effects are expected to be discounted by the standard 
Australian 5% annual rate.

Statistical analysis
Analysis of efficacy will be done for the intention- to- treat 
(ITT) set (all randomised patients who have taken at least 

Open access

one  dose  of  the  prescribed  ASM)  and  the  per- protocol 
set (patients in the ML group for whom neurologists did 
not prescribe the recommended drug will be excluded). 
The  Cochran- Mantel- Haenszel  test  stratified  by  centres 
(to account for variation between centres) will compare 
the  differences  in  12- month  seizure- free  rate;  retention 
rate  (affected  by  both  efficacy  and  tolerability)  of  the 
initial treatment at 1 year; and proportion of patients who 
achieve clinically meaningful improvement in quality of 
life.  Cox  regression  will  be  used  to  assess  differences  in 
time  to  treatment  failure  and  time  to  first  seizure  after 
treatment  initiation  between  the  two  groups.  Prescrip-
tion patterns of the two groups will be compared. In the 
ML  group,  we  will  also  compare  the  outcomes  between 
patients who are prescribed the ML recommended ASMs 
and  those  who  are  prescribed  non- ML  recommended 
ASMs  by  their  neurologists.  This  will  include  analysis  of 
the  reason  provided  by  the  neurologists  in  cases  where 
ML recommendation was rejected. Also, the outcomes of 
different  ASM  groups  such  as  sodium  channel  blockers 
versus non- sodium channel blockers will be compared.

Validation of EpiMD in the control group will be done 
by comparing the predicted response to the neurologist- 
selected ASM treatment outcome. A probability threshold 
of 0.55 will be applied in classifying treatment success or 
failure to calculate the model’s sensitivity, specificity and 
area under the curve.

To assess cost- effectiveness in the economic evaluation, 
cost  differences  and  effect  differences  for  10 000  boot-
strap  draws  will  be  analysed  from  the  trial  dataset  over 
a  1- year  time  horizon.  This  will  be  represented  using  a 
cost- effective  plane  and  a  cost- effectiveness  acceptability 
curve.26  This  analysis  will  be  performed  both  from  the 
public healthcare and societal perspective. Consideration 
was  given  to  the  inclusion  of  an  elderly  cohort,  particu-
larly due to the prevalence of epilepsy in this age group. 
However, to match the current retirement age, we intend 
to  maintain  the  upper  age  limit  of  67.  Based  on  the 
analytic results, future study directions such as extended 
follow- up  duration  will  be  considered,  and  given  the 
distinct health and social needs of the older adult popu-
lation,27 we propose the future development of a model 
specific to this cohort.

Patient and public involvement
Members  of  the  public  have  been  involved  since  the 
design stage of this trial. Through a collaboration with the 
patient  support  organisation  Epilepsy  Action  Australia, 
the lived experience expert (CS) was an associate inves-
tigator  on  the  grant  proposal  and  led  the  development 
of the trial consumer engagement strategy. This strategy 
involved  forming  a  consumer  committee  comprised  of 
people with epilepsy and is co- chaired by the lived expe-
rience expert and one of the trial investigators (EF). The 
committee will be responsible for ongoing review of the 
trial  protocol  and  participant- facing  trial  documents. 
The  Epilepsy  Action  Australia  also  facilitated  interviews 
of  patients  with  epilepsy.  The  result  of  these  interviews

indicated consumer support and acceptance for the use 
of AI in ASM selection.28

Sample size
Based on previous RCTs in newly diagnosed epilepsy29–32 
and observation in the Glasgow and Perth cohorts,4 33 the 
12- month seizure- free rate on the first ASM in the usual 
care group is assumed to be 35% and to follow a distri-
bution of Binomial (1000, 0.35) in participating sites. In 
keeping with ILAE recommendations for detecting clin-
ically  significant  benefit,34  we  hypothesise  that  the  ITT 
12- month seizure rate will be 20% higher (ie, 55%) when 
EpiMD  is  used.  Allowing  for  non- compliance  with  the 
recommended drug by the investigators in 10% of patients 
in  the  ML  group,  with  a  one- sided  significance  level  of 
0.025  and  80%  power,  accounting  for  10%  dropout,  a 
total of 234 participants (117 patients per group) will be 
recruited, determined from the 95th percentile of 1000 
simulations. This will provide 90% power to detect a 23% 
higher  ITT  1- year  seizure  rate  in  the  ML  group.  This 
sample size will provide 80% power for the same minimal 
detectable effect size in retention rates and proportion of 
patients  who  report  clinically  meaningful  improvement 
in QOLIE- 31 total score. Additionally, this will provide for 
a minimum detectable HR of 0.58 in exit due to lack of 
efficacy,  adverse  events  or  any  reason,  and  time  to  first 
seizure, assuming overall at least 50% event rates.

Data security and handling
Clinical information
The clinical information is collected in this study during 
an  initial  interview,  follow- up  clinical  visits,  from  data 
extracted from the EMR, text extraction from EEG and 
MRI reports, and from the results of questionnaires and 
assessments  on  the  study  schedule  (see  table  1).  These 
data,  along  with  all  associated  identifying  information, 
will be held within the Monash University hosted REDCap 
Database. Within that database, an ‘identifying variable’ 
marker  is  applied  to  any  identifying  information.  That 
information  is  paired  with  the  participants  assigned 
unique Study Record ID, when any data are exported from 
the  REDCap  server  for  analysis,  information  containing 
the identifying marker can be excluded from the export, 
allowing  for  curated  management  of  the  dataset  and 
protection  from  identification.  Any  data  (both  identi-
fying and non- identifying) contained within the REDCap 
Database  is  treated  as  sensitive  health  information  and 
only  members  of  the  research  team  will  be  authorised 
with login credentials allowing them to view the data. A 
smaller group again will be authorised with write access 
to  the  database.  Access  to  the  research  database  will  be 
audited  using  the  individual  login  credentials  provided. 
The  principal  and  associate  investigators  from  each  site 
will only have access to identifying information from their 
own site as approved by their own site ethics and gover-
nance. The coordinating principal investigator and main 
site  study  coordinator  will  have  access  to  all  identifying 
information. Health information that has been collected 

6

will be kept for a minimum of 15 years. The PICFs contain 
additional  opt- in  consent  items  relating  to  retention  of 
health information for future research. Data from partic-
ipants who agree to these optional consent items will be 
retained indefinitely.

ML model
The code required to run EpiMD is hosted on a secure 
Australian  Research  Data  Commons  Nectar  Research 
Cloud  instance  using  Monash  University  access.  Once 
all  clinical  variables  required  for  the  model  have  been 
entered in the REDCap survey, the investigator can follow 
a secure REDCap link that will initiate a run of the model 
and  direct  them  back  to  the  study  REDCap  where  the 
model  results  can  be  found.  After  the  processing  time 
has completed, the recommendation will be sent to the 
REDCap result page. This page will display the results of 
the  model  and  contain  a  text  field  to  provide  feedback 
about the decision- making surrounding the ASM recom-
mendation (ie, whether the clinician chooses to prescribe 
the recommended ASM). This feedback, along with the 
individual score for each ASM assessed, will be retained 
for later analysis. For quality control and troubleshooting, 
an activity log of all variables and results that have been 
sent to and from the model is maintained on the model 
server.

Ethics and dissemination
This study has been granted multisite ethics approval by 
the Alfred Hospital HREC (Alfred HREC: 130/23) for all 
sites under National Mutual Acceptance (94107). Results 
from this study will be disseminated through publications 
in  peer- reviewed  journals  and  presentations  at  scien-
tific  conferences.  Any  amendments  to  the  protocol  will 
be  approved  by  the  relevant  HREC  prior  to  implemen-
tation.  These  changes  will  be  reflected  with  an  update 
to  the  ANZCTR  registration  (ANZCTR  trial  number: 
ACTRN12623000209695).  We  confirm  that  we  have 
read  the  journal’s  position  on  issues  involved  in  ethical 
publication and affirm that this report is consistent with 
those guidelines. Findings will be presented in academic 
conferences and submitted to peer- reviewed journals for 
publication.
