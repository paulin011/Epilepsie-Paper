SUMMARY

Purpose: To pool data from four published case–control
studies of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)
with live controls, to increase the power to determine risk
factors.
Methods: Case–control studies from the United States,
Sweden, Scotland, and England were combined. SUDEP
was deﬁned as (1) a history of epilepsy (>1 epileptic sei-
zure during a period of <5 years); (2) death occurring sud-
denly; (3) death unexpected (i.e., no life-threatening
illness); and (4) death remained unexplained after all
investigative efforts, including autopsy. Deﬁnite SUDEP
required all criteria. Logistic regression analyses adjusted
for study. Further analysis simultaneously adjusted for
study, age at death, gender, and duration of epilepsy.
Key Findings: Of the risk factors that could be analyzed
across some or all studies, those that were statistically
signiﬁcant were increased frequency of generalized

In univariate analysis,

tonic–clonic seizures (GTCS), use of polytherapy, dura-
tion of epilepsy, young age at onset, gender, symptomatic
etiology, and lamotrigine therapy. Results persisted when
epilepsy onset was younger than 16 years and when it was
16 years or older.
lamotrigine
therapy was associated with signiﬁcantly increased risk
for SUDEP among individuals with idiopathic generalized
epilepsy.
Signiﬁcance: This analysis reﬁnes the identiﬁcation of
people with epilepsy that are at particular risk of
SUDEP. The emerging proﬁle indicates that people with
early onset refractory symptomatic epilepsy with fre-
quent GTCS and antiepileptic drug (AED) polytherapy
are at higher risk. The results suggest that reduction of
the number of GTCS is a priority, of more importance
than reducing the number of AEDs. The role of AEDs
and other treatment should be analyzed further in
future studies.
KEY WORDS: SUDEP, Epilepsy, Case–control study.

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the
most common condition-related cause of death in chronic
epilepsy (Tomson et al., 2008; Surges et al., 2009). SUDEP
is generally defined as the sudden, unexpected, witnessed or
unwitnessed, nontraumatic, and nondrowning death in
patients with epilepsy with or without evidence for a sei-
zure, and excluding documented status epilepticus, in which
postmortem examination does not reveal a structural or toxi-
cologic cause for death (Nashef, 1997). Cases fulfilling the
above definition fall into the ‘‘definite SUDEP’’ category;
sudden deaths occurring in benign circumstances with no
known competing cause for death but without autopsy are
classified as ‘‘probable SUDEP.’’ Cases where SUDEP

cannot be excluded, either because of limited information
regarding death circumstances or because there is a plausi-
ble competing explanation for death, are classified as ‘‘pos-
sible SUDEP’’ (Annegers, 1997).

Sudden death is at least 20 times more common in people
with epilepsy compared with the general population (Ficker
et al., 1998). The risk of SUDEP, however, varies widely
within the epilepsy population (Tomson et al., 2008). There
is a 100-fold range in SUDEP incidence within the epilepsy
population, from 0.09 per 1,000 in prospective community-
based studies of newly diagnosed patients up to 9 per 1,000
in epilepsy surgery candidates (T(cid:2)llez-Zenteno et al., 2005;
Tomson et al., 2008).

Case–control studies using living people with epilepsy as
controls have aimed at identifying factors that distinguish
the epilepsy patient at risk for SUDEP (Nilsson et al., 1999;
Walczak et al., 2001; Langan et al., 2005; Hitiris et al.,
2007). Patient demographics, seizure and epilepsy charac-
teristics, comorbidities, and treatment with AEDs have thus
to a variable extent been analyzed as risk factors in these

1150

studies. Some risk factors, for example, high frequency of
generalized tonic–clonic seizures (GTCS), have been con-
sistently identified. Results are inconsistent across studies
and there is a lack of precision in the risk estimates, which,
at least partly, can be attributed to small number of cases in
most studies.

To counteract these limitations, the Task Force on Epide-
miology explored the possibilities of pooling data from the
major case–control studies of SUDEP. The present study is
the result of this work.

Methods

We combined the data from the four case–control stud-
ies of risk factors for SUDEP, which used living people
with epilepsy as controls; a U.S. study (Walczak et al.,
2001), a Swedish study (Nilsson et al., 1999), a Scottish
study (Hitiris et al., 2007), and an English study (Langan
et al., 2005). In each study, SUDEP was defined as (1) a
history of epilepsy (more than one epileptic seizure during
a period of <5 years); (2) death occurring suddenly; (3)
death unexpected (i.e., there was no life-threatening ill-
ness); and (4) death remaining unexplained after all inves-
tigative efforts,
including autopsy. Definite SUDEP
required all four criteria and probable required criteria
1–3. The methods of each of these studies are described
briefly below.

Description of cohorts

U.S. study

Definite and probable cases of SUDEP were identified
from three upper Midwestern epilepsy centers between June
1, 1991 and December 31, 1996. For each case of SUDEP,
four controls were randomly selected from people enrolled
during the same month at the same epilepsy center. Potential
SUDEP risk factors were ascertained through chart review.
The total study consisted of 20 cases and 80 controls
(Walczak et al., 2001).

Swedish study

Cases and controls were drawn from Stockholm residents
aged 15–70 years, who were discharged from hospital with
a diagnosis of epilepsy between 1980 and 1989. Definite
and probable SUDEP cases were drawn from this cohort if
they had died by December 31, 1991 and had a diagnosis of
epilepsy on the death certificate, and did not die due to sta-
tus epilepticus or accidents. For each case of SUDEP, three
living controls were randomly drawn from the study popula-
tion and matched on year of birth, sex, and assessment per-
iod. Cases and controls were restricted to those who
received at least one continuous year of valproate, phenyt-
oin, or carbamazepine therapy. Medical
records were
abstracted to obtain information on risk factors for cases and
controls and then reviewed by the same two neurologists.

1151

Combined SUDEP Analysis

The total study consisted of 56 cases and 157 controls
(Nilsson et al., 1999).

Scottish study

Cases with definite or probable SUDEP were drawn from
people with active seizure disorders, registered with the Epi-
lepsy Unit since 1982. For each case, two living controls
were randomly selected from the Epilepsy Unit population
and matched on year of birth, gender, and syndrome classifi-
cation (i.e., idiopathic, cryptogenic, or symptomatic). Clini-
cal data on possible risk factors for SUDEP were abstracted
from the medical record according to a structured protocol.
The total study consisted of 64 cases and 119 controls
(Hitiris et al., 2007).

English study

Between 1989 and 1998, cases, aged 16–50 years, with
SUDEP were identified by coroners, neurologists, self-
referred by family members, and by the charity Epilepsy
Bereaved. Four controls with epilepsy were randomly
selected from a diagnostic index and a prescription database
and matched to each SUDEP case according to age and geo-
graphic location. Potential SUDEP risk factors were ascer-
tained from medical
for controls and from
records
semistructured interviews with family members, general
practitioners, and hospital consultants for cases. The total
study consisted of 149 cases and 602 controls (Langan et al.,
2005).

Combined cohort

The combined cohort consisted of cases and controls
from the four studies, excluding six cases with evidence of a
history of heart disease that did not account for sudden death
on the autopsy. An additional 28 controls were excluded
because they had a history of heart disease. Therefore, the
final sample consisted of 289 cases and 958 controls
(Table S1).

Potential SUDEP risk factors

Information on risk factors was not collected in the same
way for all factors across all studies. Whenever the same
factor was collected across more than one study, it was
defined for the combined analysis according to the categori-
zation that could be applied to all datasets with that specific
piece of information. We considered several risk factors for
SUDEP,
including demographic characteristics, seizure
characteristics, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and comorbidi-
ties.

Risk factors included in all four studies

We considered gender, age at onset of epilepsy, duration
of epilepsy, and age (defined as age at death for cases and
age at the cases’ death for controls). Idiopathic/cryptogenic
etiology was defined according to the epidemiologic defini-
tion (Commission, 1993) and refers to epilepsy of unknown

cause. Dummy variables were formed to evaluate mono-
therapy with any AED and polytherapy compared to no
AED therapy.

Risk factors in three of the four studies

England, Scotland, and Sweden: We evaluated the associ-
ation between idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and
SUDEP and the interaction between gender and IGE.

England, United States, and Sweden: We considered the
impact of a history of epilepsy surgery on the risk for
SUDEP as well as the yearly frequency of GTCS (as none,
1–2, ‡3, and unknown), and the combined effect of yearly
frequency of GTCS (as none, 1–2 or unknown frequency,
and ‡3) and no therapy or monotherapy versus polytherapy.
In the analysis, the group with unknown GTCS frequency
was combined with the group with 1–2 GTCS because
results were similar for these groups. Finally, we examined
the association between SUDEP and a comorbid mental
health disorder.

England, United States, and Scotland: We examined the

association between lamotrigine therapy and SUDEP.

United States, Scotland, and Sweden: We considered
antemortem AED levels in the U.S., Scottish, and Swedish
studies. High levels were defined as >12 mg/L for carba-
mazepine, 20 mg/L for phenytoin, and 100 mg/L for valp-
roic acid. Low levels were defined as <3 mg/L for
carbamazepine, 10 mg/L for phenytoin, and 40 mg/L for
valproic acid.

Risk factors in two of the four studies

England and United States: We assessed the relationship
between mental retardation (defined as a full scale IQ < 70
or as ‘‘mental retardation’’) and SUDEP.

England and Sweden: In these studies, it was possible to
evaluate the relationship between SUDEP and the presence
of comorbid alcohol abuse and lung disorders.

England and Scotland: Within these studies, we assessed
the interaction between lamotrigine therapy and IGE on the
risk for SUDEP.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed with SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
U.S.A.), using the Mantel-Haenszel method for categorical
variables with testing at the two-tailed level of 0.05.

The original studies were matched on one or more factors.
For the combined analysis, we ignored the matching, but
adjusted for study, age (a matching variable in three of the
four studies), and gender (a matching variable in two of the
four studies). Clinic was a matching variable in the U.S.
study and general practice region was a matching variable
in the study from England. After a subgroup analysis
restricted to the U.S. study, we did not observe a significant
difference in the results before and after additional adjust-
ment for clinic. Therefore, this factor is not adjusted for in
our analyses.

Epilepsia, 52(6):1150–1159, 2011
doi: 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2010.02952.x

Risk factors for SUDEP were examined using logistic
regression. Crude analyses were adjusted for study with the
English study as the referent and the U.S. study as the refer-
ent when the English study was excluded from the analysis.
Multivariate analysis adjusted for study, age, gender, and
duration of epilepsy. Because age at epilepsy onset
<16 years was associated with SUDEP risk (Nilsson et al.,
1999), we conducted separate crude analyses of SUDEP risk
factors stratifying by age at epilepsy onset >16 years and
£16 years in order to determine whether SUDEP risk factors
were different
in children compared to adults. To test
whether the use of logistic regression was suitable for this
study, we compared the results obtained from a standard
logistic regression analysis with results from an analysis in
which we used nonlinear mixed methods, assuming a bino-
mial distribution for the dependent variable, with a random
intercept for each data source (Friedenreich, 1993). Because
both analyses yielded similar results, we concluded that
logistic regression was a suitable approach.

Results

Across the four studies, after exclusions (cases = 6; con-
trols = 28) there were 289 cases and 958 controls (Table 1).
Compared to controls, cases were more likely to have longer
duration of epilepsy (p < 0.001), less likely to have idio-
pathic/cryptogenic etiology (p = 0.026), and more likely to
be on polytherapy (p < 0.001). Greater frequency of GTCS
was observed in cases from England, the United States, and
Sweden (p = 0.001). Cases were more likely than controls
to be taking lamotrigine (p = 0.002) in grouped data from
England, the United States, and Scotland.

Demographic variables

Several predictors of SUDEP were identified. Male
gender was associated with a 1.4-fold increased risk for
SUDEP. Compared to people with an onset age between 16
and 60 years, patients with onset of epilepsy younger than
16 years had a statistically significant 1.72-fold increased
risk for SUDEP; those with onset after age 60 were 60% less
likely to have SUDEP, but this was not statistically signifi-
cant (Table 1).

Epilepsy factors

Duration of epilepsy for more than 15 years was associ-
ated with a 1.95-fold increased risk of SUDEP. Increasing
number of GTCS per year was associated with a statistically
significant increased risk for SUDEP compared with people
without GTCS [odds ratio (OR) 2.94 for 1–2 GTCS,
OR 8.28 for 3–12 GTCS, OR 9.06 for 13–50 GTCS, and
OR 14.51 for >50 GTCS]. Polytherapy was also associated
with increased risk. When frequency of GTCS and antiepi-
leptic drug (AED) therapy were considered together, we
found a gradient in risk for SUDEP. Compared to those
without GTCS on no AED therapy or monotherapy, the risk

fold for those with 1–2 GTCS or unknown number on no
therapy or monotherapy, 10.40-fold for those with 1–2
GTCS or unknown GTCS and polytherapy, 13.90-fold for
those with ‡3 GTC and no therapy or monotherapy, and
25.20-fold for those with ‡3 GTCS and polytherapy. These
results suggest that GTCS frequency and polytherapy con-
tributed to SUDEP risk (Table 1).

Idiopathic/cryptogenic etiology and idiopathic general-
ized epilepsy (IGE) were associated with a lower risk for
SUDEP. We considered whether there was an interaction
between IGE and gender on the risk for SUDEP. Compared
with female patients without IGE, female patients with IGE
were protected from developing SUDEP (OR 0.39), but a
similar relationship was not observed for male patients with
or without IGE.

Antiepileptic drug therapy

Compared to no AED therapy, polytherapy was associ-
increased risk for
ated with a statistically significant
SUDEP. Monotherapy was protective for SUDEP, but this
was not statistically significant (Table 1).

We examined high antemortem blood levels of carbamaz-
epine, phenytoin, and valproic acid as possible SUDEP risk
factors; only valproic acid levels >100 mg/L were associ-
ated with an increased SUDEP risk, but this was not statisti-
cally significant. Low blood levels of each of the three
monotherapies were not associated with SUDEP.

Comorbidities

There was a suggestion of associations between a history
of alcohol abuse, learning difficulty, and SUDEP, although
these associations did not reach statistical significance.
Other comorbidities, including mental health disorders and
lung disease, were not significantly associated with SUDEP
(Table 1).

Analysis stratified by age at epilepsy onset

We examined whether risk factors for SUDEP differed by
age at epilepsy onset stratified as <16 years and ‡16 years
(Table 2). Among those with a younger age at epilepsy
onset, a longer duration of epilepsy was associated with a
3.2-fold increased risk of SUDEP, as was >2 GTCS per
year. Among those with an older age at onset, the risk for
SUDEP was increased among male patients, among those
with alcohol abuse, whereas a longer duration of epilepsy
and idiopathic etiology were protective. In addition, in the
older age group, the risk for SUDEP was increased among
those with alcohol abuse. However, after additional adjust-
ment for number of GTCS and for age at death, the associa-
tion between alcohol abuse and SUDEP was no longer
significant [OR 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–
3.53]. AED monotherapy was associated with a significant
protective effect for SUDEP for those with older age at
onset only, whereas polytherapy was associated with an

1155

increased risk for developing SUDEP for those with a youn-
ger age at onset only (Table 2). There was a statistically sig-
nificant increased risk for developing SUDEP among those
on lamotrigine therapy in the younger age at onset group.

Discussion

We found that increased frequency of GTCS, use of poly-
therapy, duration of epilepsy, young age at onset, gender,
symptomatic etiology, and lamotrigine therapy were signifi-
cantly associated with SUDEP (Table 3). It is important to
understand that this does not mean that people with idio-
pathic epilepsy or those with a few GTCS per year are pro-
tected from SUDEP. In fact, such patients represented a
significant proportion of the cases in the included studies
(Table 1). The observed relationships persisted in analysis
restricted to epilepsy onset at age younger than 16 years and
to onset at age 16 years or older. In addition, lamotrigine
therapy was associated with significantly increased risk for
SUDEP when prescribed to individuals with IGE in univari-
ate analyses restricted to pooled data from England and
Scotland (Table 1). These observations are in line with
those of previous uncontrolled case-series observations sug-
gestive of an association between SUDEP risk and lamotri-
gine treatment of idiopathic epilepsy (Aurlien et al., 2007).
Various mechanisms have been proposed for this potential
association (Nashef & Ryvlin, 2009). These include the
possibility of less efficacy of lamotrigine in some specific
idiopathic epilepsy syndromes. Arrhythmogenic cardiac
effects, perhaps through lamotrigine inhibition of
the
delayed rectifier potassium ion current (Ikr), have been pro-
posed as another mechanism (Danielsson et al., 2005).
Among women, those with IGE were at a lower risk for
SUDEP compared to those without IGE in pooled data from
England, Scotland, and Sweden. Compared to people with
no GTCS on no AED therapy or monotherapy, 1–2 GTCS
per year was associated with increased risk for SUDEP
among those on monotherapy and those on polytherapy as
was >3 GTCS per year in pooled data from England, the
United States, and Sweden. Comorbid mental health disor-
ders were protective for SUDEP in the pooled data from
England, United States, and Sweden. This association,
although not statistically significant, could theoretically be
a reflection of medication for the comorbidity, since it has
been suggested that treatment with SSRI antidepressants,
that raise serotonin levels, might reduce the SUDEP risk
(Tupal & Faingold, 2006). Interestingly, monotherapy was
associated with a lower risk for SUDEP in those with epi-
lepsy onset at 16 years or older, but not for those with onset
younger than 16. In contrast, the increased risk for SUDEP
associated with polytherapy was limited to those with youn-
ger age at onset. We have no obvious explanation for this
discrepancy by age at onset. Other age-dependent circum-
stances might contribute. Nighttime supervision was shown
to be protective in the United Kingdom study (Langan et al.,

2005). Such supervision is likely to be more common
among younger people living with their parents and could
perhaps modify the risks of untreated epilepsy.

Results of pooled data from all four case–control studies
are consistent with some results from the individual studies.
The analysis also revealed several risk factors that were not
previously identified in any of the studies by themselves,
including lamotrigine therapy, male gender, and symptom-
atic etiology. We were unable to confirm associations
between SUDEP and seizure frequency in general (Nilsson
et al., 1999; Walczak et al., 2001), although we found a
relationship between frequency of GTCS and SUDEP.
Data for some factors were collected only in individual
studies, including full scale IQ (Walczak et al., 2001),
dementia (Nilsson et al., 1999), absence of cardiovascular
disease (Nilsson et al., 1999), number of dose changes per
year (Nilsson et al., 1999), anxiolytics (Nilsson et al.,
1999), seizures in the last year before SUDEP (Hitiris et al.,
2007), not treated with AEDs (Langan et al., 2005), and
sleeping alone in a room (Langan et al., 2005).

In any combined analysis, the methodologic concern is
that heterogeneity in the populations and methods may
influence the pooled results. A significant strength of our
pooled analysis is that case and control definitions and risk
factor ascertainment were consistent across the four studies,

lessening the chance that heterogeneity influenced the
results. In all four studies, cases were definite or probable
SUDEP, and controls were people with epilepsy who were
alive and were selected from the same population that gave
rise to the cases. Risk factors in each study were ascertained
through chart review. A potential weakness is that there are
differences between the studies in the ratio of matching
cases to controls, the matching variables, and whether age
was restricted. The Swedish study was confined to cases and
controls who received at least 1 year of valproate, phenyt-
oin, or carbamazepine therapy. Not all the risk factors exam-
ined in the combined analysis were collected in all four
studies. Because of these differences between studies, we
evaluated whether meaningful heterogeneity existed. First
we adjusted for study, age at death, gender, and duration of
epilepsy, which were matching variables used in at least one
study and assessed in all four studies. Second, we compared
results from the logistic regression analysis to those
obtained with nonlinear mixed models with a random inter-
cept for each study (Friedenreich, 1993). Results of these
analyses were essentially the same, supporting a lack of
meaningful heterogeneity. A second potential weakness is
that the English study was at least threefold larger than any
of the other studies and could overly influence the combined
results. Instead we found that only one of the six significant

risk factors from the English study persisted in the pooled
analysis.

This combined analysis helps refine the identification of
people with epilepsy at a particular increased risk of SU-
DEP. The emerging profile is the person with early onset
refractory symptomatic epilepsy with frequent GTCS and
AED polytherapy. The data suggest that the priority should
be to minimize the number of GTCS, which is more impor-
tant than reducing the number of AEDs. The roles of AEDs
and other pharmacologic treatment should be analyzed fur-
ther in future studies. This is particularly important consid-
ering the suggestion of lamotrigine as a potential SUDEP
risk factor, which will need to be confirmed or refuted in
independent studies. A further challenge for future research
is to focus on patients with refractory epilepsy to clarify
what features may distinguish the patients in this high-risk
population who die in SUDEP from those who survive.
