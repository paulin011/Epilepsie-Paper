  abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain characterized by an enduring (i.e., persisting) predisposition to generate seizures, unprovoked by any immediate central nervous system insult, and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of seizure recurrences. Epilepsy affects both sexes and all ages with worldwide distribution. The prevalence and the incidence of epilepsy are slightly higher in men compared to women and tend to peak in the elderly, reflecting the higher frequency of stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and tumors in this age-group. Focal seizures are more common than generalized seizures both in children and in adults. The etiology of epilepsy varies according to the sociodemographic characteristics of the affected populations and the extent of the diagnostic workup, but a documented cause is still lacking in about 50\% of cases from high-income countries (HIC). The overall prognosis of epilepsy is favorable in the majority of patients when measured by seizure freedom. Reports from low/middle-income countries (LMIC; where patients with epilepsy are largely untreated) give prevalence and remission rates that overlap those of HICs. As the incidence of epilepsy appears higher in most LMICs, the overlapping prevalence can be explained by misdiagnosis, acute symptomatic seizures and premature mortality. Studies have consistently shown that about one-half of cases tend to achieve prolonged seizure remission. However, more recent reports on the long-term prognosis of epilepsy have identified differing prognostic patterns, including early and late remission, a relapsing-remitting course, and even a worsening course (characterized by remission followed by relapse and unremitting seizures). Epilepsy per se carries a low mortality risk, but significant differences in mortality rates are expected when comparing incidence and prevalence studies, children and adults, and persons with idiopathic and symptomatic seizures. Sudden unexplained death is most frequent in people with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, and drug refractory epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy affects more than 50 million people worldwide, making it one of the world’s most prevalent neurological diseases. The main symptom of epilepsy is seizures, which occur abruptly and can cause serious injury or death. The ability to predict the occurrence of an epileptic seizure could alleviate many risks and stresses people with epilepsy face. We formulate the problem of detecting preictal (or pre-seizure) with reference to normal EEG as a precursor to incoming seizure. To this end, we developed several supervised deep learning approaches model to identify preictal EEG from normal EEG. We further develop novel unsupervised deep learning approaches to train the models on only normal EEG, and detecting pre-seizure EEG as an anomalous event. These deep learning models were trained and evaluated on two large EEG seizure datasets in a person-specific manner. We found that both supervised and unsupervised approaches are feasible; however, their performance varies depending on the patient, approach and architecture. This new line of research has the potential to develop therapeutic interventions and save human lives.},

  abstract = {Background: Smartwatches are widely adopted globally for tracking health metrics, offering potential for enhancing individual healthcare and public health efforts. Continuous use of the devices and users’ willingness to share the data collected are critical to realizing their full benefits. Objective: To identify key factors that determine continuous smartwatch use and users’ comfort levels in sharing health data with healthcare providers and public health authorities. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of current and past smartwatch users (age {$>$}18 years) was conducted to assess determinants of continuous use based on the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) and user comfort levels with different data-sharing methods. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate relationships between habit formation, satisfaction, perceived enjoyment, and perceived usefulness with continuous use.  Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests were used to analyse user comfort in sharing data, comparing non-internet versus internet-based sharing methods and fully versus partially anonymized data. Results: : 273 responses were analyzed, with participants aged 18-65 years (mean = 35.6, SD = 11.7). The result indicates that continuous use of smart watches is explained by habit (β = 0.35; P {$<$} .001) and satisfaction (β = 0.38; P {$<$} .001), which is in turn explained by perceived usefulness (β = 0.38; P {$<$} .001), perceived enjoyment (β = 0.32; P {$<$} .001), confirmation (β = 0.24, P {$<$} .001), and perceived usability (β = 0.10; P =.03).  Smartwatch users preferred non-internet-based sharing options (Z = -5.793, p {$<$} .001) when sharing data with their physician. Similarly, users were more comfortable sharing fully anonymized data with public health authorities than partially anonymized data (Z = -3.592, p {$<$} .001). Conclusions: Habit formation and satisfaction emerged as pivotal drivers of continuous intention to use smartwatches, emphasizing the need for features that foster integration into daily routine and a rewarding user experience. Preferences for non-internet-based data sharing with physicians highlights privacy concerns which must be addressed to build user’s trust. By aligning device features and data-sharing protocols with user preferences, manufacturers, healthcare providers, and policymakers can enhance user engagement and maximize the potential of smartwatches to support individual health management and public health initiatives.},

  abstract = {This article presents an in-depth experimental study of Ensemble Deep Learning techniques on small datasets for the analysis of time-series data generated by wearable devices. Deep Learning networks generally require large datasets for training. In some health care applications, such as the real-time smartwatch-based fall detection, there are no publicly available, large, annotated datasets that can be used for training, due to the nature of the problem (i.e., a fall is not a common event). We conducted a series of offline experiments using two different datasets of simulated falls for training various ensemble models. Our offline experimental results show that an ensemble of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, combined by the stacking ensemble technique, outperforms a single RNN model trained on the same data samples. Nonetheless, fall detection models trained on simulated falls and activities of daily living performed by test subjects in a controlled environment, suffer from low precision due to high false-positive rates. In this work, through a set of real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the low precision can be mitigated via the collection of false-positive feedback by the end-users. The final Ensemble RNN model, after re-training with real-world user archived data and feedback, achieved a significantly higher precision without reducing much of the recall in a real-world setting.},

  abstract = {A reliable seizure detection or prediction device can potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with epileptic seizures. Previous findings indicating alterations in cardiac activity during seizures suggest the usefulness of cardiac parameters for seizure detection or prediction. This study aims to examine available studies on seizure detection and prediction based on cardiac parameters using non‐invasive wearable devices. The Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to systematically search according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis guidelines. Human studies that evaluated seizure detection or prediction based on cardiac parameters collected using wearable devices were included. The QUADAS‐2 tool and proposed standards for validation for seizure detection devices were used for quality assessment. Twenty‐four articles were identified and included in the analysis. Twenty studies evaluated seizure detection algorithms, and four studies focused on seizure prediction. Most studies used either a wrist‐worn or chest‐worn device for data acquisition. Among the seizure detection studies, cardiac parameters utilized for the algorithms mainly included heart rate (HR) (n\,=\,11) or a combination of HR and heart rate variability (HRV) (n\,=\,6). HR‐based seizure detection studies collectively reported a sensitivity range of 56\%‐100\% and a false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.02‐8/h, with most studies performing retrospective validation of the algorithms. Three of the seizure prediction studies retrospectively validated multimodal algorithms, combining cardiac features with other physiological signals. Only one study prospectively validated their seizure prediction algorithm using HRV extracted from ECG data collected from a custom wearable device. These studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using cardiac parameters for seizure detection and prediction with wearable devices, with varying algorithmic performance. Many studies are in the proof‐of‐principle stage, and evidence for real‐time detection or prediction is currently limited. Future studies should prioritize further refinement of the algorithm performance with prospective validation using large‐scale longitudinal data.},

  abstract = {Background Remote patient monitoring (RPM) has emerged as a viable and valuable care delivery method to improve chronic disease management. In light of the high prevalence and substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), this systematic review examines the cost and cost-effectiveness of using RPM to manage CVD in the United States. Methods We systematically searched databases to identify potentially relevant research. Findings were synthesized for cost and cost-effectiveness by economic study type with consideration of study perspective, intervention, clinical outcome, and time horizon. The methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Economic Evaluations. Results Thirteen articles with fourteen studies published between 2011 and 2021 were included in the final review. Studies from the provider perspective with a narrow scope of cost components identified higher costs and similar effectiveness for the RPM group relative to the usual care group. However, studies from payer and healthcare sector perspectives indicate better clinical effectiveness of RPM relative to usual care, with two cost-utility analysis studies suggesting that RPM relative to usual care is a cost-effective tool for CVD management even at the conservative \$50,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year threshold. Additionally, all model-based studies revealed that RPM is cost-effective in the long run. Conclusions Full economic evaluations identified RPM as a potentially cost-effective tool, particularly for long-term CVD management. In addition to the current literature, rigorous economic analysis with a broader perspective is needed in evaluating the value and economic sustainability of RPM.},
